		<Q6.1><![CDATA[•	June-July 2007-2011: I spent 5 consecutive summers at Gold Arrow Camp, a summer camp located on Huntington Lake in the Sierra National Forest, California. The first fours summers, I spent the two-week long sessions as a camper, participating in outdoors activities such as climbing natural rock formations, sailing, waterskiing, ropes courses, day hikes, and overnight backpacking trips. From the perspective of a camper, I really enjoyed this fun introduction to the outdoors, learning basic outdoors and safety skills in the process. My final summer at GAC, I took on some responsibility as a Counselor-In-Training (CIT), in which I assisted an actual counselor with leading a group of 11 to 12 year old campers in the same outdoor activities I had experienced as a camper myself. From the other side of camp, I learned a lot about what goes into making an outdoor experience immersive, safe, and social. I learned to belay in rock climbing, handle homesick campers, settle disagreements, and encourage campers to try new (and perhaps daunting) activities, all the while trying to make it a fun experience for everyone involved. Having been on the FOPper side of a FOP trip, I think some of these skills could come in handy as a leader.
•	circa 2008-2013: I have gone on very many day hikes with friends in the southern California area where I grew up. Frequenting the Santa Monica Mountains, Temescal Canyon, and Malibu Canyon, I learned a lot about preparing and planning for trips as well as how to be safe on the trail. In addition to procuring the necessary supplies for the given trip, I became better at reading maps and gauging the difficulty of a trail. Also these trips have made me more comfortable being in somewhat remote outdoor situations in which I need to take responsibility for myself and whomever I’m with on the trail.
•	August 2013 / October 2013: I went on a FOP trip and a WOOP trip this year, having a blast both times. I learned a few new skills on the go such as knot tying, setting up the P-tarp, and hanging a bear bag on a high branch. Moreover, on my WOOP trip, we encountered an unexpected bout of snow and hail, which was a lot of fun, but required us to move a lot faster in setting up camp.
•	May 24, 2013: A friend and I organized a 13-mile night-hike from Mandeville Canyon to our high school in North Hollywood. A group of 8 friends of mine, all seniors at my high school, went on the hike, and we arrived at school on time, albeit extremely tired. ]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[•	July 2011: As a CIT (mentioned above), I taught skills necessary for the campers’ activities. For example, when belaying campers who were rock climbing, I gave them advice to help them get to the top of the formation. Also, I taught campers how to sail on the lake.
•	2012-2013 school year: I was Managing Editor for my student-run high school newspaper, The Chronicle. In addition to overseeing the production of a 36 page paper every month, I was responsible for leading meetings for each of the paper’s four sections and speaking in front of a staff of nearly 100 students. Also I helped run workshops in which I co-taught journalism skills such as interviewing, sourcing, and structuring stories.
•	Summer 2011-Summer 2013: I worked at a UCLA laboratory with a group of about 8 undergrads, post-docs, and lab techs. I was responsible for helping them with any experiments they were working on and eventually designing some experiments on my own. My last year at the lab, I helped teach a new lab worker some of the experimental methods that we used. I think this experience contributed to my development, because I had to learn a very large amount of new skills in a relatively short time in order to be helpful, responsible, and safe in the lab.]]></Q6.2>

		<Q7.2>My greatest strength in leading a group of first-year students would be my ability and willingness to listen. This could simply mean listening to a joke or comment, or it could mean listening to something more serious like a safety concern or a disagreement. In both cases, I think my ability to listen to the people around me would enable me to ensure that they are comfortable and having an awesome time in the backcountry.
Another strength I would bring to the backcountry is my ability to think clearly and improvise in unexpected, stressful, or emergency situations. Whether it is merely an inconvenience like rainy weather or a real emergency such as an injury in the backcountry, it is extremely important for a leader to able to react responsibly and sensibly in such situations.
A third  strength I would have in leading a group is my comfort with the outdoors. For a first-year, it would be really distracting and unsettling to see your FOP leader appear unsure or uncomfortable in the backcountry given that he or she is responsible for your safety. As such, I think my ability to remain calm and collected in all situations will make the trips a lot more enjoyable for FOPpers.
Last, but not least, I love jokes and think I have a good sense of humor. This can be important in the backcountry because humor can help make any trip a lot more fun and memorable or help people get through physical challenges. </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[One of my greatest challenge in leading a group of first-year students would be my tendency to be somewhat introverted in new social situations. This could be challenging because I may come off as quiet or shy upon first encounter, but I know I would be able to rise to this challenge as a leader.
	I think another challenge would be learning large amounts of information about the group of students in a short time. Freshman year (this year), I struggled somewhat to learn peoples’ names and backgrounds the first time I met them. However, as the year went on, I improved on this front and I think I could do the same on a FOP trip.
	Another challenge could be the fact that this would be an utterly new experience for me. While I have spent much time in the outdoors, and even a fair amount of time in the backcountry, I have always had an adult to bear the onus of responsibility for the group. Being completely responsible for the group would be a new, daunting, and likely difficult challenge, though one that I eagerly look forward to overcoming.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[A difficult decision I encountered somewhat recently was the decision to move away from home to the other side of the country. For the last two years of high school, I lived at home with a single mom, since my dad passed away and my brother went away to college. My mom, though independent for the most part, occasionally needed a hand in carrying out commonplace tasks, especially ones relating to 21st century technology. As much as she repeatedly insisted that my going away for college was completely normal and justified, I couldn’t shake the sense that I was abandoning her to pursue my own interests. I ultimately decided to leave for a few reasons:
	First and foremost, I considered that getting a fantastic education would ultimately enable me to support my mom in the long run even though staying near home might be beneficial to her in the short term. Another factor in my decision was the thought that she and my dad had worked really hard to enable my brother and I to go to good schools thus far, so to compromise the next potential step in my education would be at odds with their wishes and hopes for me.
	Now, I realize there was one factor I didn’t consider in my decision. In addition to my inability to assist my mom day-to-day, my geographical absence seems to have made her transition into an “empty nest” particularly difficult in the sense that she rarely sees me in person.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[First, I was concerned by Phillip’s tendency to ignore his fellow FOPper Daniel’s interest in his stories. Daniel seemed to be making an effort to befriend Phillip, though Phillip shut him out instead talking to Peter, my co-leader. Since he took a gap-year, perhaps he feels that he is too mature to befriend his fellow FOPpers, though I personally don’t think his actions spoke to his maturity. This concerns me because by trying to befriend a leader rather than a fellow FOPper, Phillip was simultaneously isolating himself from the rest of the FOPpers and making Daniel probably feel bad by being unresponsive to him. FOP is there to help people meet new classmates and adjust to a new environment with new people. So, Phillip’s behavior is preventing both himself and Daniel from having the best possible FOP experience. I would react to this by trying to organize some activities or games on the trail and during breaks from hiking that foster interaction between the FOPpers. Also, I would do lead a 5-minute autobiography game at the campfire that night where everyone can go around and share their stories so that Phillip might be able to appreciate the maturity and diverse backgrounds of his fellow FOPpers.
	In the same vein, I was concerned by Suzy’s tendency to stick (metaphorically) to Mark on the trail and during activities. Even though Mark doesn’t seem to mind the attention, I think Suzy is infatuated with Mark to the extent that it is preventing her from getting to know the rest of her fellow FOPpers. On my FOP trip, even though I didn’t become best friends with everyone on it, the experience of getting to know the other people on the trip made me more comfortable with the transition into college, knowing that everyone came from really awesome backgrounds and had a story to tell. Suzy, only getting to know Mark, may be missing out on some of the FOP experience. So, I would react by changing up the hiking order throughout tomorrow’s hike, so that she can talk to other people in the backcountry.
	Lastly, I was concerned by the three FOPpers who seemed to be exceedingly quiet or reserved, Jack, Kelly*, and Renee (once she started giving short answers). While it is definitely OK to be introverted or shy, this was a concern to me because they are not interacting with the rest of the group. As I mentioned above, part of FOP is becoming comfortable getting to know people and appreciate the variety of backgrounds people have. I would try to facilitate this with activities to help these and all FOPpers break out of their shells. I have found that a shared laugh can help do this quite well. So maybe a variation on the game of charades could be a fun way to get people to interact more comfortably. *Also, as a safety concern, I would encourage Kelly to put on another layer or two because she is shivering.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1>While my FOP Switch-Service trip was the first time that I had been backpacking, I have been camping and frequently hike, bike, or run in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park right next to my home. I have gone camping under a tent with my family at least four times, and each time, I made sure to help my parents as much as possible with cooking, setting up the tent, and planning the trip. I also convinced them to take us white water rafting for two of these trips, when it was possible, and we enjoyed ourselves each time.</Q6.1>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I am extremely optimistic, agreeable, and understanding. Consequently, I get along really well in groups of people, and people generally trust me enough to open up to me. Along these same lines and due to these traits, I put people at ease, and I am not one to polarize a group. 
I also am extremely responsible, and I would care for my first-year students safety and well-being as my first priority. However, despite some of my maternal instincts, I still love to have fun, and I would definitely be flexible and open to trying new and enjoyable activities. I am definitely open-minded and thoughtful, and I am receptive to others’ differences and ideas, even if it may seem “weird” to others.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[One of my greatest challenges would be having enough confidence in myself and my decision making skills. After every decision I make—when I do make a difficult one, I end up questioning my own choices. I recognize that I am not necessarily the best, smartest, or wisest, so I will oftentimes question my own judgment, and sometimes this might make me question my own authority.
I also would have difficulty trying to make everyone happy to the point that sometimes it hinders me from making hard decisions and enjoying myself.
Also, for a FOPper who may have questions about adjusting to college, I wouldn’t be able to give definitive answers. I feel as if though part of this is due to the fact that there are no hard answers and solutions to adjusting to college and figuring out what college is meant to be, but I am still very much finding out who I am. I think this contributes to my plagues of self-doubt sometimes as aforementioned, since I don’t exactly feel as if though I am in a place of authority. I sometimes feel like I don’t have the wisdom to pass on to others as I still haven’t figured out my own life, so I just have to try and remind myself that sometimes, being in similar shoes is all that I can help with.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Although seemingly petty, I had a difficult time deciding to drop from math 23 to math 21. My friends expected me to challenge myself by taking hard classes, and I was liable to compare myself—they were taking much more difficult classes. There was the possibility that I would be able to handle the class and gain a lot out of it. I may have enjoyed it too given that my favorite class has always been math. On a more superficial level, my closer friends were also in math 23, and I thoroughly enjoyed psetting/bonding with them.
	However, I was spending all of my weekend completing the problem set, much more than most people, due to the fact that I came from a less mathematically rigorous background. I had also been skipping a ton of events and didn’t have time for extracurricular activities, which have always meant so much to me.
	I dropped. I talked to my advisors and my parents, and they suggested that adjusting to college would take more time than I realized, and I would probably enjoy myself more if I kept myself sane. Though less respectable of a choice—and possibly putting me behind if I wanted to concentrate in math, I figured that it was more important to lay down a solid foundation and stay true to my own values—which were my extracurricular activities. My friends would still be my friends, even if it wouldn’t have been the decision they would’ve made.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[1) I am concerned about Renee and her happiness. She seems to not identify as much with Lizzie and Matilda’s upbringing. Optimally, I would want her to feel comfortable with the FOP group, so I would talk to her personally, assuring her that no one judges her for her background. I would encourage her to express her concerns and not feel limited by what she has or hasn’t done—I could also talk from my own experience: having been from a small suburb and coming in on a ton of financial aid, I was at first concerned that Harvard would be segregated into socioeconomic groups, but starting from my own FOP trip, I found myself bonding with so many different kinds of people, and my time on campus has reflected a similar situation. 

But in the case that she doesn’t bond with the other FOPpers as much, I wouldn’t want her Harvard and freshman year experience to be limited by her own self-preclusion from certain friendships and activities due to misconceived perceptions, so I would reassure her that especially during one’s time at Harvard, at least in my own experience, one is not defined in any way by one’s background.

2) I’m also worried about Kelly. While she says she’s fine, she seems to be the type of person who would sacrifice herself from others before she takes care of herself. While this is something I respect, it also means that if there IS something wrong, she probably wouldn’t speak up willing about it. As some people are quiet by default, I don’t think it’s necessary that she suddenly becomes the most outgoing FOPper, especially if that’s outside her natural personality. However, I would also talk to her to try and get to know her better and understand her values, her upbringing, and her hopes and concerns. While it is entirely possible that she is enjoying the FOP trip, I would want to talk to her about what she hoped for and expected out of the FOP trip, and what she thought of it so far.

I would also check on her physical well-being. Perhaps to help with her shivering I would encourage her to ask us to stop and put on/take off layers as necessary, and if she doesn’t have extra layers, perhaps I would have some. 

3) Likewise, I would want to talk to Jack about similar things for similar reasons. Even if he doesn’t feel comfortable opening up to the group, I would want them to know that they always have a non-judgmental set of friendly ears to listen to anything that was on their mind in me. While I can’t force anyone to talk about anything, I would encourage them to feel free and express anything they want to me and/or to my co-leader.

Another thing I might try to do as we get into camp is to pick out a group activity that encourages everyone to open up about themselves and bond with each other.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.3>Being outdoors and being a leader have yet to coincide for me, so doing both at once will be a new experience and will require acting in ways I cannot now anticipate. Though I have no doubt that I will be adequately prepared if and when the time comes to lead a trip, the novelty of the situation will still test my resourcefulness. </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[My freshman year of high school I had to decide whether to join the debate team. I was relatively quiet and only interested in science and math, but the team promised to teach the skills needed to speak in public and argue persuasively. Everything I would do would put me far out of my comfort zone. I would also have to stay late after school and give up my weekends, making it even harder to complete the workload. Weighing the considerable challenges against the potential benefits, I had to choose what the focus of my next four years would be only a few weeks into high school. I thought about what I wanted to get out of high school, what I was willing to give up, and how I would balance everything with taking care of myself. I joined and am glad I did – the tradeoffs I identified were the only substantial negative effects, and the benefits were tremendous. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5>1. Renee appears distressed. Feeling out of place might be accentuating her fears about transitioning to college and is definitely making her not enjoy her trip. This is bad for her psychological wellbeing and for group cohesion. I would respond by asking her once at camp about what concerns her, and if it seems appropriate I would raise the topic of difference at that night's activity.
2. While competition can be fun and foster cohesion, competition involving tying knots to secure lines under tension carries more potential for danger than is healthy. I would supervise the knot-tying, encourage caution, and talk with Peter afterwards about my concern and to find safer avenues for competitive spirit. 
3. Getting lost was likely a simple mistake, and I would spend a few extra minutes going over route plans with Peter to hedge against such mistakes in the future. </Q7.5>

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[I did apply to lead FOP last year, and since then, I have taken time off (Fall 2013) from school to pursue my interests
-- education and being outdoors. I will be returning to school in the Spring 2014 semester. In my time off, I have
gotten the opportunity to explore the Four Corners area, which has developed my love for being in nature
(especially mountain and canyons!). I had the opportunity to work jobs that required me to be in an outdoors/crew
setting for an extensive period of time, which in turn contributed to my knowledge, comfort, and love for the
outdoors. In addition, I met people in Colorado who taught me new outdoors skills that they were passionate about and then came on adventures with me as I pursued these new interests and hobbies.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I believe that there are four important qualities of a great FOP leader and they are – humility, practicing what you preach, a passion for the outdoors, and the ability to have fun. I have observed these traits in both my FOP and SCC crew leaders, and I believe that I have acquired these qualities as well. Humility is important on FOP because we are not in a position to think of ourselves as more experienced or knowledgeable than the first-years. Rather, we are in a position to be a resource of Harvard knowledge, enforcer of safety, and facilitator of group discussions and bonding. We can learn from each person on the trip, and each one of us has room to grow. In addition to practicing humility, I make it a priority to strive for unity in my thoughts, actions, and speech. If I teach the first-years about LNT, then I better be practicing it as well. It is also very important to love the outdoors if you are to lead FOP. Passion is contagious. My love for the outdoors has blossomed over this past year, and as a result – so has my outdoor experience. A variety of outdoor experiences makes a leader interesting, and a leader’s passion for the outdoors would facilitate a similar response in the first-years, which will ultimately make for a beneficial trip. FOP is about providing a positive, fun, enlightening, and rewarding environment for first-years, and having fun is an integral part in that. I can be a leader that is relatable, positive, funny, and even silly at times! I am able to have fun, and want to create an environment when fun is always encouraged. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I believe a challenge that I could face while leading a group of first-years would be being able to strike the correct balance between making sure each person takes care of himself/herself and the crew, but at the same time— not being too controlling and restrictive. It is extremely important for each member to take care of himself/herself and the crew by being sanitary around food, using good personal hygiene, minding safety, and participating in group chores, but the leader can’t always be the one to remind the rest of the group about these responsibilities. Everyone needs to take ownership of these tasks. However, each group is different. Some first-years may need more reminding than others. Striking the balance between giving each person his/her freedom and ownership of these responsibilities, and at the same time – making sure no task is neglected in order to keep the safety and well-being of the crew, is difficult and requires frequent adjustments. It may take me a couple of days to get a feel for the group and decide how to best approach those situations with my co-leader. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Recently, I have decided to become a vegetarian. After 20 years of meat-consummation, this has been a difficult decision for me. The idea of being vegetarian first arose during my study of yoga and its principles. The primary principle of yoga is “ahimsa,” which means “nonharming to the self and others.” I began to think about how this applied to the animals that I consumed. Since I was working on a trail crew at this time, and on hitch we basically already ate vegetarian, I decided to give vegetarianism a try. While practicing, I did research and found out that by not consuming meat, I was reducing my risk of food-borne illnesses, reducing pollution and waste, avoiding toxic chemicals, helping reduce famine, and of course – sparing animals. Although I realized that my personal boycott is not making that great of a difference, it’s about the principle of not contributing to those practices. However, I did not really consider how vegetarianism would affect my health. So far, I have been having enough energy and am maintaining weight. I find other protein sources. Therefore, this decision arose from some ponderings that I had one day and from the situation that I found myself in, but after research, I became even more pleased with my decision to become vegetarian. Vegetarianism has been a challenge, especially every time bacon or Sesame Chicken tempts me, but I know that I am doing it for the right reasons. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Exclusive relationships: I have been taught that whenever you are in a crew setting, it is best to avoid exclusive relationships. Exclusive relationships can be romantic, but they also can include friendships that exclude others (like that of Lizzie and Matilda). Lizzie and Matilda's friendship is a concern for me because it excludes others, and does not give each of them the opportunity to learn more about the others in the group. Although it is awesome that they are so compatible and have had similar experiences, it is important to not allow similarities with one person to impede other relationships on a trip. To address this situation, I would take Lizzie and Matilda aside and remind them that FOP is an incredible opportunity to learn about themselves and others in an active environment, and this opportunity should be taken advantage of. And although it is wonderful that they have become so close, it would be great to branch out and have conversations with others on the trip. They will have all of the rest of their lives to continue their great friendship. 

Must let leader know if there is anything bothering you: It concerns me that Kelly says she is fine when she is shivering and cold. I think that it is important to establish a culture in a trip that it is okay to ask for help or anything that you need. Everyone should always check-in on each other for comfort and safety. She may be saying that she is fine to not appear weak in front of the others. To address this, I would just check in with her to make sure that she knows she can ask me for anything, and to let me know if there is anything that I can do to help. We all have to help take care of each other. Sometimes small problems when ignored, can turn into larger problems.  

Facilitate first-year bonding: It concerns me that the FOP group seems a bit fractured, for instance -- Kelly and Jack are pretty quiet and don't talk to others; Phillip is mostly interested in talking to Peter and is uninterested in talking to Daniel; and Lizzie and Matilda talk mostly to each other about their similar upbringings. I understand that not everyone needs to be talking to everyone, always, and at the same time, but it is important to implement some group bonding experiences for the first-years. I would speak to Peter about the situation, hear his thoughts on it, and then plan with him to introduce some fun group exercises that we could do while hiking and back at camp to facilitate conversation between the first-years, find similarities, and learn more about each other.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think that my greatest strength as a FOP leader would be that I am careful but confident leader. As a student and athlete I am always organized and well-prepared. I work to be as ready as possible for anything I might face, but when I do come to an unanticipated obstacle, I am able to approach it confident in the work and preparation I have done previously. 

As a member of the Harvard swim team, and countless teams before that, I have learned what it means to be a good teammate, and I think that these skills could be applied to leading FOP. I understand what it means to work hard and push myself, as well as being able to motivate and encourage my teammates. We see time and time again how much more we can accomplish together rather than as individuals and the same holds true for a FOP group. I think that as a FOP leader I would be able to push my group to do things they didn’t think they were capable of while working as a team. 


The number one thing that makes me want to be a FOP leader is my admiration of my FOP leaders from this past August. Jared and Becky were incredibly loving and caring, and made each of us feel welcome and included. I like to think that I am the type of person who could create that type of environment, one that helped me so much in my transition to Harvard, for new incoming freshmen, and would love nothing more. My own love of the outdoors could keep everyone engaged and involved, and I would be attentive to everyone’s needs and feelings so they feel just as comfortable as I did on my own FOP trip. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>I think that my greatest challenge in leading a group of first-year students would be staying patient. I expect a lot from people and sometimes push them too hard. I expect that it might be challenging for me to accept that a participant has reached their limit or is truly doing their best if it does not seem that way to me. I am a persistent and competitive person, and expect nothing less than the absolute best effort from those around me. As a FOP leader I would need to work to make a trip challenging for FOPpers but not more than they can handle. </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[When I was in 8th grade I made the decision to turn in a classmate for cheating on a test. This was a challenging decision because I didn’t want to be a rat, or for that classmate to get in trouble, but her cheating was against my own personal sense of right and wrong. The first time I saw her cheating, I talked to her about it first, and offered to help her study next time so she wouldn’t feel like she had to cheat. She thanked me and let it go. I did not ultimately decide to turn her in until I saw her cheating on the next test. Then I went to the teacher and told him what I had seen. Although I felt bad about getting her in trouble, and didn’t want her to dislike me if she ever found out it was I who had turned her in, I felt that it wasn’t fair to all of the other students who had studied hard for the test and done their best work without cheating if she had done better by breaking the rules. Nothing ever came of my turning her in, but I felt that I had considered all of the important factors and ultimately made the correct decision and one that I was able to sit easy with. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My biggest concern with how the day in this scenario is going is the exclusive relationships that seem to be forming. Lizzie and Matilda seem to be excluding Renee, after having made her feel uncomfortable with talk about their expensive travels and world experiences. Suzy seems to be preoccupied with getting Mark’s attention rather than talking to lots of other people. Similarly, Phillip is especially interested in talking to Peter and is not really branching out and talking to the other FOPpers. This is a concern for me because exclusive friendships like these take away from the cohesiveness of the group as a whole and may make some of the more quiet FOPpers, like Kelly and Jack feel like they aren’t being included. To address this problem, Peter and I would meet that evening and discuss different ways to include everyone during the hiking the next day. Playing groups games with everyone while hiking would be a great way to get everyone to talk to each other, even those other FOPpers that they haven’t spent as much time getting to know throughout the day. We would also decide different ways to make the group line up, to mix up who they are next to so they are not only hanging out with a few people. One purpose of FOP is to get to know a whole group of new people, so I would make sure that that happens, and that certain FOPpers are not only getting to know specific others. 

Another concern of mine would be the unfair share of work that Mark is doing. I would pull him aside and tell him that although everyone appreciates what he is doing to help out, teamwork is a large and important component of the FOP experience, and that it is important that everyone helps out and does their fair share, both in carrying group gear and helping with chores such as setting up camp. For the next day when we got into camp I would designate certain other FOPpers to help Mark with whatever he is doing to help out. I would also talk to the FOPpers whose personal gear Mark was carrying and check in as to how they are doing and why they feel they can not carry all of their own gear, and then take it from there.

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Peer Mentor – College Access Program Fall ’12- Spring ‘13
Participated in mentor-mentee program. Mentee was undocumented high school student from Everett, helped her apply to scholarships, edited her essays, and helped her cope emotionally with the transition to college and other issues specifically faced by undocumented students. Met with her weekly over a couple of slices of Noch’s 
Boatswain’s Mate – Boy Scouts of America, Sea Scouts, Ship 435 Summer ’11,’12,’13
Helped organize outing events for a group of 8 peers, including sailing trip along Texas ICW, multiple kayaking trips, and sailing training events. Above all, endeavored to build cooperation and participation as dictated by the mission of the Boy Scouts organization. Learned a lot from the high-stress, demanding, and immediate response the sailing calls for especially when working with a crew. 
Big Brother- ’95- ‘13
With two younger siblings, I think it’s important for me to recognize the leadership and learning experiences I’ve had as an older brother. Coaching my younger sibling in academics, friendships, relationships, and just life has been very important to my formation. They are two people I constantly have in mind, because I have seen first-hand how they can learn from my experiences and have guidance that I wish I would have had in their position.

		<Q7.2>My extensive outdoor experience has given me a chance to see a lot of what can go wrong, even with a perfect plan. My experiences have also given me deep understanding of the importance of preparation and safety, making me ready to dedicate and commit a lot of effort to the preliminary tasks of FOP. </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I’m afraid of being annoying to first-years, especially because I won’t hold back from speaking out when I think their safety is at even the smallest degree of danger. From hazards like dehydration to getting too wet, I’ll probably one of the more outspoken leaders. I am afraid that this behavior could compromise a connection I have with a first-year. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[When I first got to Harvard, I thought I was the only undocumented student here. With that, I was confronted the big decision of letting my friends know about my status or not. Although being “illegal” was strange thing to talk about with my friends, I thought it was a big enough factor of my formation and upbringing that ultimately I thought necessary to reveal. I also considered how it could affect my family at home; by revealing my personal status I’d automatically be revealing theirs. 

As I realized the importance of educating other about this issue, I decided to publish an op-ed describing my experience, I decided to not only let my friends know, but everyone else as well. Although it was an extremely difficult decision for me, I learned compassionate, tolerant, and open-arms campus that Harvard is. After publishing my article, I many received many emails from other undocumented Harvard students and allies. I went from feeling alone to accepted. 
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[I am concerned for Kelly’s FOP experience, and more importantly for her health. She seems cold and vulnerable to the weather. As much as I can, I’d remind her to stay warm by wearing more clothes or snacking more. I would try to find the right moment to tell her about my concerns, so she is able to tell I am legitimately concerned. I would try to have conversations between her and Peter about her experience, how she is enjoying the FOP trip, and whether there is anything we can do to make her feel more comfortable. I think communication with her would be key, and I would provide her with ample opportunity to voice any concerns she has whether they are fop related, college related, or even personal. Talking with Peter, we could think of ways to have both Kelly and Jack be more involved with the group in general. 

Another pressing issue for me would be the increasing disconnection between Renee and the other Foppers. It appears she is very aware of the differences in their upbringings and feels somewhat inadequate. Growing up in a small town, and being the first from my high school to attend an ivy-league school, sometimes gave me the same feelings of inadequacy and inferiority. Harvard is diverse in the socio-economic spectrum of its students, so it is and issue that could adversely affect Renee for a long time, like it did me. As I talked to Renee and throughout the trip, I would like to point out her unique contributions to the experience, and also try to help her see her own talents and strengths. 
In the situation presented, I would try to share about my first year experiences in overcoming feelings of inadequacy, and more importantly make myself available to her so she feels comfortable sharing her feelings. 

In a way that is non-targeting, I would acknowledge some of the realistic dangers and the carefulness that alcohol must be treated with. Daniel’s seemingly harmless invitation to “get trashed” to the other Fopper exemplifies a harmful but existing culture in Freshman dorms. Sometimes these statements create a pressure that may make someone feel uncomfortable, especially those who don’t drink or aren’t sure whether they want to drink. Around a campfire or at an appropriate time, I would try to have an inclusive conversation about recognizing and overcoming peer pressures. I’d really like for my group to know that Harvard above anything else, is an accepting and non-judgmental community, and that they should never do something that makes them feel uncomfortable.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[I had virtually little knowledge of outdoor experience prior to becoming a FOP participant two summers ago. The goal for me then was to ease the transition to Harvard, connect and make friends, and to use this FOP experience as a microcosm, a challenge to myself, to prove that I could both survive the outdoors and prevail at Harvard. I worried that my lack of outdoor knowledge would leave me out of many activities but pleasantly found that the program imparted camaraderie, working-together, shared fears of coming to Harvard and success as a whole so much so that my inexperience did not affect me or my other camper mates. I quickly learned that the outdoors is the venue, but what is learned by the campers gets applied in every class, dorm, club and D-hall across this campus. That said its leaders need to guarantee safety, be able to spot emergencies, act quickly in times of danger and use good judgment. I am level-headed in unfamiliar situations, have a strong sense of responsibility and I care about others and the environment.  I have addressed these same needs with many of my PAFees, although not in an outdoor situation, but still relative to addressing primary needs of safety, health and welfare and responsibility of a group. My sense of comfort with the outdoors greatly improved as a result of my FOP experience but I am not so naïve to think that one outdoor experience would qualify me as an expert in the outdoors. By pairing me with other leaders who have greater outdoor experiences, I can share my vast PAF experience creating an experience for FOPers that will be safe, secure, and helpful in adjustment to new situations. I will get the FOPers  to feel good about  the choices they made to come to Harvard and to become a FOPer. To me, this is what FOP is all about.]]></Q6.1>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[My greatest strength is my experience as a PAF. In this capacity, I am able to recognize patterns of certain behaviors, of students isolating themselves, of students questioning their own abilities or matching themselves against the abilities of other students, of feelings of inadequacies triumphed by those of achieving personal success. I am a caring and concerned individual who can and will reach-out and create inclusion. My other greatest strength is that I did this same program myself with absolutely no outdoor experience at the time. The fact is I strongly believe that FOP needs to attract those with and without outdoor experiences because what the program imparts sets the ground-work for a favorable beginning at Harvard. Having a FOP leader openly discuss her Harvard experiences both good and bad who sensed my inexperience with the outdoors, my anxiety over connecting and fears of what lie ahead was the difference between disaster and a great beginning at Harvard. I always felt that the program marketed those with outdoor experiences greater than mine and that just isn’t the case. This program is for everyone. My FOP experience increased my comfort level with the outdoors and together with my good judgment and level-headed approach to unfamiliar situations, strong sense of responsibility and caring of others, I can impart my experiences onto the next group of freshmen, which is exactly the reason that I strongly believe that I am a great choice as a leader at this time.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>My greatest challenge is my lack of outdoor experience as far as understanding how to set-up camp grounds, tents, etc. to survive well and to ensure the same for my campers in an outdoor setting for a week.  I would expect to be fully trained and to be proficient by the time of FOP next summer. Therefore, I understand that it is required that I am fully trained and agree to undergo whatever time and training is necessary to achieve this level of proficiency. I want my campers to be trusting in me and my outdoor skills and I want to be competent myself as a leader in this outdoor environment. I am presently competent of my skills as a leader but need to feel the same as a leader in an outdoor venue.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>I had a friend confide something to me which I believed required the attention of those higher than myself. It was a difficult decision to call because of the delicate decision of balancing privileged information and anonymity with what I believed would be in her best interest at the time. I determined that some mental health factors were to be considered and that this person was behaving in a manner that was harmful to her at that time. I passed this information onto someone in a position to help her but in doing so I received her wrath because she felt that I betrayed her confidence. Her safety and mental health were paramount to me so I tried to let her words of anger towards me not sway my opinion or judgment but it was difficult. By telling me she elicited my confidence, however, I was not in a position to be of any help to her therefore it was apparent that I needed to entrust the help of another even if it meant betraying her confidence. I weighed my decisions carefully and tried to consider only choices helpful to her. I hope that in the future she would come to realize that my actions were in her best interest and made because I cared.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Renee’s  close proximity in hiking next to me, coupled with her communicating less with the others, triggers my thoughts on how to get her to feel better connected with me and the others, and less isolated, in spite of her feeling left out of discussions due to  the extensive travels of the others. I would try and engage conversation with her, then finding out some things about her, perhaps facilitate a connection with others in the group who may have something in common. I would watch her closely over the next few days to be certain that she does not feel left out and I would do this in a way that is not obvious. If there are signs of Renee feeling left out, chances are that there are other FOPers who are feeling the same but might not be manifesting these signs.

When I have a chance to speak with Peter alone, I could mention that I thought that I noticed an eye roll when Phillip was speaking to him. As leaders, it is our responsibility to realize that all FOPers are in a new environment and each has their own way of processing this new environment. Some may brag and others like Renee will become very quiet perhaps intimidated and stay physically close to us. I may mention to Peter that it is not our job to be “approving or disapproving” and perhaps if I “caught” the eye roll chances are that some of the FOPers did too and that is not our place as leaders to pass judgments. 

As dinner cooks, I prepare for what I believe to be the best and most productive part of the day and that will be the “bonding session” before bedtime when I will try and connect the good and the bad of the day. I will see that Renee now has some topic of conversation where she will prevail which will engage good responses from us the leaders and the FOPers of the group. I will thank Mark for stepping up and helping everyone but also gently nudge all the FOPers to carry their own loads figuratively and literally because Mark’s place is not to carry the load for everyone. I will encourage Lizzie and Matilda to discuss issues that will include the conversation of others too and will politely draw the conversation away from Phillip when it is not in the best interests of the others. Lastly I will place a blanket around Kelly to let her know that it is okay to voice her opinions and to be different than the others if she needs extra layers of warmth when the other FOPers do not. Each of us needs to learn what will make us feel connected, productive and get the most out of this journey and we need to be able to voice this in our own ways and to not feel judged by anyone else. Then I will feel that I was a good leader.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[- (Growing up) Boy Scouts of America. My participation for 12 years led to me being extremely comfortable in the outdoors. I have probably averaged five camping trips a year since the age of six, mostly in the woods, including annual summer camp where we worked on outdoors skills. I am now an Eagle Scout.
- (July 2007) Trip to the Minnesota Finger Lakes, where we canoed and portaged our way through a 75 mile trek in 4.5 days.  We carried all our stuff, at the beginning my pack weighed about ½ of what I weighed then! Most memorable was canoeing through an extremely strong, sudden storm in order to get back to camp. I was an active participant!
- (June 2010) I biked down the Maryland –Virginia border trail over the course of a week, camping in various parks on the way. Over 200 miles in 5 days, ending in D.C.! I was an active participant!
- (July 2011) Trip to the Florida Keys, living on a deserted island (Big Munson Island) for 5 days and participating in a variety of activities like sea kayaking and fishing. I was my group’s leader, in charge of making the larger decisions (like what to eat/ what to do) and assigning roles and jobs to younger scouts.
- (January 2013) Wilderness First Responder Training at Harvard. I am now a certified WFR.
- various other trips in Canada, China, and the US that I’d love to talk about in more detail if you ask!

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[This year had been one of tremendous growth both intellectually and personally, and I feel significantly better prepared to lead a FOP trip this year compared to last year. I want to highlight two experiences from this past year that have led to tremendous personal growth. First, this year I served as a course assistant for Math 21a. This was my first time on an official teaching staff, and I greatly enjoyed it. Teaching in the context of a full course was extremely rewarding because it allowed me to develop relationships with the students and use that relationship to help them understand the material. I enjoyed the challenge of thinking in different ways, ways that I had never even considered before, in order to help each student. Coming out of this experience, I think I am more patient and effective at working with a variety of people to help them learn and appreciate new material. The second experience that I want to highlight is my journey through China this past summer. For a three-week period, I was fortunate enough to be able to travel through China alone, visiting places like the Yunnan (near the Himalayas), Xi’an, and Beijing. During my time travelling, I got to do a number of outdoors activities, such as biking around a 120km lake (Erhu, in Dali) or climbing on of China’s five sacred mountains (Huashan, near Xi’an). Coming out of this experience, I grew tremendously in terms of understanding responsibility and consequences. Being on my own, halfway around the world from home and in a land where I did not speak the language very well, I learned how to take care of myself in a new environment and still get the most out of the experience. I think the experience of learning to manage an unknown environment and learning to work in different ways to effectively teach different people will help me tremendously in leading a FOP trip.]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[My strengths would be my ability to improvise in the outdoors and my ability to coordinate a group. Through my experience with Scouting while growing up, I have learned to improvise outdoor solutions to the various issues that come up, for example making a makeshift-sail out of bed sheets while canoeing on the ocean. My mentality of making use of what is available to solve problems will definitely help with the inevitable problems that come up on a FOP trip, as we will have extremely limited access to immediate help. Experiences like serving as an Exec on the Crimson have given me confidence in leading a group towards a goal, like designing a 16-page magazine every week in the case of the Crimson. I have learned how to fairly divide up work and encourage team members so as to optimize productivity and optimism. I have also learned how and when to approach various members of the team when they are feeling down and lift their spirits up as best I can. The ability to work in a group and get the most out of each member will similarly be crucial when leading a trip, as inevitably some Fop’pers will be weaker than others; maintaining cohesion and positivity throughout the group, while challenging, will be necessary, and I think that it is a strength of mine to ensure this cohesion.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[	My greatest challenge would be discerning when to push people to extend their comfort zone, and when to ease off. Over the course of the trip, there will undoubtedly be things that people fear doing, even though they are capable. As a leader, it would be my job to weigh how much the student would benefit from being pushed. I think I often lean towards being passive and allowing people to do what they want; on FOP, I think my challenge would be to step up as a leader and challenge others to challenge themselves. FOP is about welcoming students into the Harvard community and teaching them to strike out and grow as a person. In that vein, pushing students yet being wholesomely supportive 100% of the time is the task of the leaders, and I think my greatest challenge would be to maintain that balance. 
         Another challenge in leading the students would be quickly establishing a strong, trusting relationship with each student. Strong, trusting relationships inevitably take time to develop, but on FOP it is crucial that students trust the leaders as soon as possible. My challenge would be to, in the short time frame of FOP, extend myself beyond the role of guide and leader, and become someone a friend that the students feel comfortable approaching with problems.

		<Q7.4><![CDATA[A difficult decision that I had to make this past month was whether to apply for a leadership position on the Crimson’s Design Board or the Business Board (I am a member of both Boards). The time had come to pick new positions, and I was forced to pick a Board to which I wanted to devote my time as a leader. On one hand, graphic design is something I truly love, and I had been an executive designer for the preceding semester. On the other hand, the opportunity to be a Business Exec on the Crimson was unique and exciting, and it offered to me the opportunity to develop a skill-set aside from what I learn in the classroom (I study physics). The questions that I considered the most were ‘what do I want to do after college?’, ‘what am I more interested in doing?’, ‘in what role will I be able to affect more positive change for others?’, and ‘through what opportunity will I develop more applicable skill?’. I realized that, although I may be interested in Business in the future, I am currently not pursuing that career and it is silly to pursue it purely for the sake of increasing potential options in that field. In the end, I decided to go with Design because it afforded me a more influential role, the chance to do what I love, and the opportunity to help others to the same.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[In general, I would look for sulkiness, withdrawal, rudeness, physical incapability, or complaining as warning signs, but in this scenario I do not see any strong concerns at the moment.
That said, my main worry is the propensity for this group to form into cliques. Naturally, the FOP’pers will gravitate to those with whom they most identify, but as a leader it is crucial to ensure that the FOP’pers feel comfortable with each other. On campus, this group will be the support network for each individual as they begin their Harvard lives, and it is crucial that they develop group unity now, on FOP. To that effect, I am concerned that certain FOP’pers seem to be spending most of their time with one or two others, exclusively. Although their friendships’ rapid development is great, I will make a note to use means such as pair walking (pairing up FOP’pers and having them walk out of talking range of the rest) in order to promote more interaction between the FOP’pers that have yet to interact. This concern umbrellas the unsocial behavior of Phillip, Renee, Kelly, and Jack, who for various reasons seem to have isolated themselves. While I cannot force them to open up or become friends with the other students, I can make an effort to break down that awkward first barrier.
My next concern is physical wellbeing, for the whole group but more specifically for Kelly and Mark. Kelly does not seem to eat much and seems to be getting cold, which could just be normal behavior for her, but also could be a sign of greater issues. However, these facts will have me keeping a closer eye on her in order to ensure that she has the appropriate gear and food intake in order to get through and get the most out of the trip. I’m also concerned about her eating so little, and will be sure to follow up during and after FOP. For Mark, while it is great that he is so helpful, I am concerned about him taking to much equipment at the beginning and then burning out. While he may be exceptionally strong, by pushing himself to hard he may wear himself out, causing much bigger problems down the road. I will divvy gear, ensuring that he does not end up with to much, and regularly make sure that he’s keeping up and content with the trip.
My last concern is staying on the same page with Peter, my co-leader. The fact that he seems to be annoyed at Phillip does not bode well for the rest of the trip, and I want to be sure that he is of the same mindset as me regarding keeping the FOP’pers developing relationships with each other and us. If I can effectively communicate with him, then we will have twice the ability to notice problems that might be coming and will be able to better guide this trip to final success.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[I have not spent a tremendous amount of time in remote settings of the outdoors, but having grown up on an island, I spent a large amount of time outside. I first camped at the age of 6 with my Girl Scout troop, an activity we did 4-5 times a year, sometimes on the island and sometimes off. During this time, we learned all of the essential outdoor skills that I found myself using on my FOP trip: cooking food over a gas stove, clearing the ground and setting up a tent, and inevitably, how to “go” in the woods. When I stopped being a Girl Scout in 8th grade, I still went camping with my friends, and sometimes helped the leaders of younger Girl Scout troops with their camping trips on Nantucket. 

Every winter, I scalloped off the shores of Nantucket with my dad went clamming off of his boat in the summer. I additionally learned to sail two summers ago when I lived on a sailboat in the Mediterranean with my Spanish host family. Over winter break, I will be working on an organic farm in Texas, where I hope to learn more outdoors skills.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[In the past year, I have gained a much more in depth understanding of what it means to be a mentor. Last spring, I began working with the Mission Hill After School Program, which I absolutely love. While the kids I work with are far younger than Harvard freshmen, I have learned what it really means to be a good role model. In Mission Hill, there is no option to not show my best self. I have to be fully invested in their well being not only every Wednesday, but every day. These kids have everything to lose if they aren’t given 100% of our time and energy, and I believe that the same is often true of Harvard freshmen. They need to be encouraged to be themselves, learn new things, and constantly be their best selves. 

I also worked very hard last spring to train for the Gloucester Half Marathon in April and the Burlington Marathon in May. I plan to run both the Burlington Marathon and the Gloucester Half Marathon. While this is not related to hiking or camping, my physical endurance benefitted from this a lot, which would be useful in leading a challenging FOP trip.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I begged my mother not to leave me the day I stepped foot for my FOP trip. My shoulders were already sore from carrying my backpack from the car a few blocks away, it was hot, and I had been dreading coming to college for months. I had a plan to keep to myself and listen to others, perhaps ask some questions to evade answering questions myself. Once we were out on the trail, I found that my plan failed me – it seemed like my FOP leaders wanted to know every detail about my life. But the more I opened up, the more comfortable I felt, and by the end of the trip I learned more about my 9 co-FOPpers than I had learned about my acquaintances from home in years. I know that I am in no means the only person who felt terrified to come to college. I truly believe that my greatest strength in leading a FOP trip would be the empathy I developed while turning what was my greatest challenge, getting over my fear leaving behind everything and everyone I knew so well, into a quality that has made me strong. I want to be just like my FOP leaders. I want the opportunity to make someone feel as welcome as I felt, to assuage someone’s fears, and most importantly, to make them feel that maybe coming to college isn’t the worst thing in the world; that it actually is the best.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think one of my greatest challenges would be working with my fellow FOP leaders to make important decisions. In high school, I was the co-editor-in-chief of my school’s student newspaper. For the first half of the year, I made most of the decisions, and my co-editor often allowed this to happen, not wanting to cause controversy or tension among the staff. Halfway through the year, I realized that through my selfishness, I had failed to listen to others and incorporate their ideas, making the newspaper lackluster and simple. When I began listening to my co-editor and the rest of the staff, I was happier with myself, and I grew in my relationships with the staff members. While addressing my selfishness and arrogance wasn’t easy for me, I know that if ever I am in another circumstance where I have to make decisions with other people, I will be able to step back and remember this experience. I am still in awe that my three leaders managed to make the game plan that they did when one of them and I became sick. Leading a FOP trip requires cooperation and collaboration, and while I have struggled with this in the past, I am confident that I have learned from my experiences enough to successfully lead a FOP trip. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I’m running. Just a mile left, maybe a little more. My legs are tired and my breath is short. My best friend, Erin is pretty far behind me. She was tired this morning and said she didn’t sleep well last night. I promised I would finish this race with her, but I’m so close to being done. I want the time I had been working for to be printed in the newspaper next to my name. I start to pick up the pace, but then I turn around. What am I thinking? Erin would never even consider finishing without me. She’s my running partner, the one who was next to me training in the cold, running next to me at the gym. She’s the partner and friend I want to race with again and again, the one who has always been by my side. And so I turn around, run back until I reach her, and finish the race with her. That choice is the reason I had someone to laugh with when we read our incredibly slow time in the newspaper the next week. It’s the reason why I felt so fulfilled eating pizza with her at our gym afterwards, surrounded by people who finished long before we did. That choice is the reason why I would make that same decision any day, any time, anywhere. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Three concerns I noticed about the scenario:

1.	My largest concern is the lack of unity among the group, which is seemingly a result of the diversity of the FOPpers, particularly in their personalities, levels of maturity, and socioeconomic statuses. Renee seems uncomfortable listening to Lizzie and Matilda’s experiences, Phillip is not only a year older, but also is more mature than some of the FOPpers, and Kelly and Jack have isolated themselves from the group almost entirely. A good way to bond the group is to take the attention away from their individual personalities or experiences from outside the woods and channel it into things that all of the FOPpers are experiencing on their trip. On my FOP trip, we would constantly fantasize about what food wanted to eat when we got back into civilization, which constantly made us laugh because everyone was hot, hungry, tired, and craving ice cream. Additionally, I would suggest that the group play the game “Contact,” which gets everyone participating and takes the attention away from the tough hiking. I also enjoyed when the leaders talked about what they liked to do on campus and what they were studying. 
2.	It is also concerning that Peter has made three important decisions without consulting me, one of which has had a large effect on our trip’s progress during that day. When things had settled down for the night, I would take Peter aside and ask him if I could help make decisions too. During my FOP trip, the three leaders each hiked in the front of the group at different periods of the day and week. This gave the leaders to learn more about and talk to all of the FOPpers, especially the ones who hiked in the back throughout the majority of the trip. I would ask Peter if I could hike in the front tomorrow and have him hike in the back. This would be a way for him to separate himself from Phillip, who is likely hiking in the front, and get to know other FOPpers. Perhaps he could connect with Jack and Kelly more than I could. 
3.	Lastly, while Mark’s dedication to helping out the group seems like a kind gesture, it is not fair. A huge part of the FOP experience is learning the essential skills to backpack over challenging terrain, which involves carrying a large amount of weight in a backpack for five days in the wilderness. FOP is supposed to be fun, but it isn’t necessarily supposed to be easy. Everyone should generally be carrying the same amount of weight. The next morning, when everyone is packing up to begin the day’s hike, I would intervene if Mark tried to take the majority of the group gear and ask if anyone else had room in their packs to take a few things. If no one responded, I would have Peter and I take some of the weight ourselves, and distribute the rest among the FOPpers.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[I am currently a leader in the Harvard Outing Club (HOC), and so during the school year I help plan and lead hiking trips with other co-leaders. I have led more laid back trips to the beach as well as more intense trips bagging peaks in the White Mountains. As a leader on these trips I help keep participants upbeat and talkative as we hike, I check in to make sure people are comfortable (getting enough water, not getting too cold/overheated etc.), and gauge group interest if we need to make any decisions about what we want to do/where we want to go as a group. Additionally, as part of HOC training I have been WFA certified and have gone on fall and winter training trips where I’ve learned how to apply both leadership and first aid instruction into real practice. But I’m also super excited at the idea of going through FOP training, since I’ve heard it emphasizes different aspects of leading trips in the wilderness and I’m open and excited to learning new things!
	I’ve also spent a lot of time hiking with friends in my spare time, and when I was younger I went to a month-long sleep-away camp in Vermont called Keewaydin where I spent most of my time going on hikes, including a week-long backpacking trip in upstate New York that ended up being one of my favorite summer experiences.
]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[In high school I held leadership roles in a number of clubs, including the Sergeant at Arms for my Youth and Government Delegation and Vice-President of the Homeless Support Club, and in both of these positions I spent a lot of time organizing events and people. Additionally, I was a co-captain of my high school’s Ultimate Frisbee team. I was by no means the best player on my team but as a captain, in addition to leading practices and games, I worked to make rookies and those players who were not the superstars of the team feel more comfortable by making myself readily available and putting in effort to make sure I was always an approachable figure and our team was never intimidating or alienating for anyone.
In addition to my experiences as a leader for HOC, I’ve spent the last two summers working as a camp counselor at Berkeley Day Camp in California where I’ve been in charge of groups of around twenty 6-10 year olds with another co-counselor. As a camp counselor my job involved making sure that all my campers stayed safe while also ensuring that they were having a good time. Among the many activities I led, from capture the flag to Wah! (a fantastic game, if you don’t know it we should change that), I often took my campers hiking around the local regional park. I think my favorite part of being a camp counselor has been connecting with campers on those hikes, and getting to talk with them and watch them grow up over the years since I was a counselor in training. Having campers remember me and want to be in my group when I come back every year always makes me proud and happy that I’ve been successful in engaging with them in a meaningful way.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think my strengths as a FOP leader would include my experience and confidence leading groups of people on hiking trips, as well as my calmness, as I am someone who doesn’t get too worried or worked up about things very easily. Also, most people don’t find me very intimidating, so I think my approachability is something that would help me as a leader. I also have a large repertoire of games to keep people preoccupied during hikes if necessary.
	Besides that I enjoy hiking and camping a lot, and so I think my excitement about the outdoors would help keep my FOPpers upbeat and into it when people might otherwise be getting tired and maybe a little less excited about the outdoors than they should be. I’m also very excited at the idea of being a part of the FOP community and of being a mentor for new freshmen as they begin to adjust into college life. I think that enthusiasm would be a central part of my role as a FOP leader and would be extremely helpful for creating a close-knit community between everyone on the trip, and I would hope that that closeness would carry over into the school year. I think my interest and dedication to being a part of and helping create an awesome and close community is one of the strongest things I could bring to the table as a FOP leader.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think a challenge I would face as a FOP leader would be my relative inexperience camping. While I have been car camping and backpacking a few times, and have been through leader training through the Harvard Outing Club, camping is still something I’m not yet confident being the authority figure for. I could definitely use a refresher on all the things you need to take into account when camping as opposed to just hiking, such as bear-bagging and picking the right spots to set up camp.
Additionally, I have very little faith in my cooking abilities out in the wilderness. I’ve had some pretty quality meals on camping trips in which others have been in charge of cooking, and I’m not so sure if I can perform up to those standards. Also, stoves. I think one of my larger fears as a leader would involve me not knowing how to use our stove/our stove breaking, and the complications that that would cause for our cooking.
And maybe also maps. I’ve never been lost or confused enough when hiking that I needed to rely on a map for anything other than deciding which way to turn at a fork, so I’m still not that great at looking at a map and being able to tell how long it will take me to get from one place to another.
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[At Berkeley Day Camp I was leading a day hike with my co-counselor on a trail I had never been on before, but it looked a little long. The hike was really fun because many of our 9-year old campers were excited to be on a new trail, and we hyped up their enthusiasm and made it out to be an adventure. However, halfway through the hike one camper, who didn’t really like hiking, said he was tired and wanted to stop. I stayed at the back with him and made sure that he was feeling fine health-wise, and was staying hydrated and putting on sunscreen, but we needed to keep moving so I assured him that the trail wasn’t much longer, and that soon we’d be back at base-camp. Nevertheless, the camper was frustrated, and even stopped on the trail once and refused to move. Other kids in the group started saying mean things to him, so I took them aside and made sure they stopped, and redirected everyone else’s attention by making up a story about the trail we were on. Then, since we were worried about making it back to the bus on time, my co-counselor led the group a little ways ahead while I stayed with the slower camper and distracted him to keep him moving, while also making sure that we never got too far behind the group. In retrospect, I should have gauged everyone’s interest in going on a long hike beforehand.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[I’m going to assume that the thunderstorm we encountered earlier—and weather in general—is not something we have to worry about. It also doesn’t sound like there’s any reason to be worried about the Gage Caves at this point. Since neither safety issue seems to be pressing, I think my three largest concerns are with my FOPpers and how they’re doing. While Mark is carrying a lot of weight and doing a lot, probably too much, in camp, it sounds like he is well-liked and doing OK, so compared to some of the other problems I don’t think I have to worry as much about him. 
It seems like Renee is feeling alienated from Lizzie and Matilda, so one thing I might do is try jumping in to change the focus of Lizzie and Matilda’s conversations back to something Renee feels more included in. If that didn’t work, I would try talking to Renee myself or getting her to talk to other people in the group, like Kelly or Jack. Or if Renee seemed uninterested in other people, I might take Lizzie or Matilda to the side and ask them to make an effort to include her, although I would be hesitant to do this unless it seemed absolutely necessary, since I wouldn’t want them to feel like I’m orchestrating their social lives or forcing them to hang out with people they don’t want to. 
Peter’s annoyance with Phillip makes me worried, as I feel like Phillip might catch on to Peter’s ambivalence and get offended. I would talk to Peter about dealing with Phillip without getting frustrated or annoyed with his stories, and make sure he didn’t role his eyes or otherwise let on that he was annoyed. I would suggest actively including Daniel in their conversations and having Peter ask Daniel a lot of questions so that he doesn’t have to listen to Phillip talk quite so much. Hopefully Phillip will start liking Daniel more, but if not Peter can at least use Phillip’s obsession with him to get Daniel and Phillip to spend more time together so Daniel doesn’t feel left out 
Kelly worries me the most, since she is shivering and not eating a whole lot, so it sounds like she isn’t taking good care of herself, which is very dangerous on a long camping trip where she needs all the energy and warmth she can get. I would try making suggestions to the group in general to do things like put on more layers and finish all their food so it wouldn’t look like I was singling Kelly out. If I got to the point where I had to make these suggestions to her specifically and she insisted that she was not cold or hungry, I would be honest with her about my concerns, and tell her respectfully that it would make me a lot more comfortable if she wore more layers and ate more during meals because I’m worried about her health.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[My greatest strength as a leader is that of a communicator. I enjoy creating relationships with people through conversation. I have also had experience creating a “team” that could paint a house. Communicating what needs to happen while painting a house is analogous to instructing setup and repacking of a campsite. I enjoy building one on one relationships and a united group dynamic. Another benefit of my experience leading the pain crew is my ability to make decisions. With so many people depending on me to make the right decision I have become comfortable making the “tough calls” based on the needs of the crew customer and company. I am someone who is used to handling responsibility and building relationships even during unpleasant tasks.  ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>My greatest challenge as a FOP leader would be my inability to answer questions about the school. I obviously have learned a good deal about how things are done but my area of study thus far has been limited. For example I feel comfortable talking about classes or program structure with someone interested in the life sciences but uncomfortable when posed with questions about CS of the English department. During my time in FOP I asked my leaders many questions about the school but also my area of study. I found these conversations informative and comforting. I worry that I do not have the knowledge or experience in enough areas of the school to host a broad field of questions.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>While finishing one paint job this summer I had to send two crew members to the next job to start while I finished the last job with the remaining crew members. I chose to send my most experienced worker along with the least experienced worker. When making this decision I had to consider all the members of the crew and the needs of both jobs. The new job required lots of heavy ladder work and scrapping. The job that was almost done required fine detail work and an eye for detail. Of the members on the crew the new worker who still had to develop as a painter was ideal for the scrapping and ladder work due to his strength. The experienced crew member I relied on to start the job correctly and teach the younger worker how to scrape efficiently. The rest of the crew was made of people who had experience with detail painting but less ability with ladders. One this that I wished I had considered was the cell phone reception at the new job site. A day after the split of the crew I was headed to the new site where the crew needed more materials but I was unable to get their phone call and so some time was wasted. In the future I communicated about what each job would need a day before to better prepare for the job.   </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[As the leader of this trip my biggest concern would be Kelly’s eating habits. She appears to be behaving in a way that might suggest some type of eating disorder. Treatment of this disorder may be something for a medical professional to deal with however it is imperative for her safety on the trip that she eat all her food. To deal with this situation I would wait until the group is busy setting up camp and I would discreetly pull Kelly to a more private area. I would explain to her the difference between hiking food and food at home. Trail food is fuel that is essential for safe hiking. I would explain that it is not an option for her to not eat all of her food and if she does get full quickly she should keep her food and eat it throughout the day. Most importantly I would try to make her feel that I was willing to work with her as apposed to lecturing her. 
	A second concern is the behavior of my Peter. While peter may be engaging with the hikers I would be concerned with his behavior while talking to Phillip and his interest in creating competitions among the foppers. I would ask Peter to have a meeting with me to touch base at some point in the evening. During our conversation I would share my concerns about the foppers and his behavior. We could talk about the goals that we had set for the trip, in terms of community building. I would ask him if he felt comfortable conferring with me, and if todays wrong turn was a result of his discomfort. I would make it clear that we were a team that needed to rely one each other. We could then talk about how we could create a more inclusive culture. 
Another worry is the vibe of the trip. The Group has become rather fractured. The small pairs of friends that have developed is not good for creating an inclusive community. FOP is a time for students to learn about their classmates, the school and themselves. Having people talking amongst themselves in an exclusive way like Lizzie and Matilda. To remedy this problem I might talk to peter and see what he thinks but I would push for saying something after dinner. If we chose to say something after dinner I would talk about the goals that we had set as a group before the trip. Without pointing out any names specifically. I would remind the group that there are people from all different backgrounds and each can offer something to the group.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[As a FOP Leader, I would be an excellent role model and great friend. I enjoy talking about my passions, and am an attentive listener to others. I would be able to strike up conversations with anyone else on the trip, curious to know everyone else’s upbringings and their backgrounds, leaving out conversation about the number of AP classes everyone took and their SAT scores. I want to actively listen to what inspires the other people on my trip, and hope that FOP will inspire them as well just as it influenced me to become more self-confident and more open to conversation. In addition, I want the pre-frosh on my trip to come to me for advice, whether it be about the college experience, family pressures, social life, or any other stresses and I will always try my best to be reassuring, letting them know that I am there as a guidepost for them. I am also confident in my ability to plan out the day’s events and make sure everyone is together and on the right trail. I am great at navigating maps as well as pacing myself when running or hiking.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I would really like to have a greater global perspective on life. I don’t know much about politics and international affairs aside from the news that people share with me, so I don’t have an opinion on many worldwide issues and cannot discuss the issues with other people. If I am FOP Leader, I want to hear other’s opinions and learn about what others find important in current events. I would also like to further improve my social skills and being able to talk with others. On another note, I think a universal challenge of all FOP leaders is how to keep the group a cohesive unit without any one person falling behind on the trails or being left out of the group. It is difficult to bring together a small crowd of people with different personalities, backgrounds, and passions, and expect all of them to get along with each other let alone eat and sleep with each other. I know that I may experience difficulties keeping the group together as I have not had much experience, but I will definitely try my best and learn and grow from leading a FOP group.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One of my most difficult decisions this year was made while trying to balance my schedule. As a freshman, moving from a high school lifestyle to a college freshman lifestyle was a dramatic change in everything I did, including how I scheduled homework time as well as extracurricular activities. After attending the extracurricular activities fair and narrowing down my vast list of activities to a few, I realized that my schedule was not realistic. With Brevia the Undergraduate Research Magazine, Harvard Comics Club, Harvard Breakers, and Harvard Varsity Team Fencing, I was still taking on too many activities with no room to breathe or complete academic work. I accepted this fact, and worked to consider which activity to drop. First, I thought about my high school background—I have a history in science research and wanted to improve my writing, which led me to join Brevia, and I fenced for seven consecutive years in high school, leading to my decision to walk onto the Harvard Fencing Team. On the other hand, I have never tried breakdancing, and my performance experience is small. In addition, I wanted to go into Comics Club to try drawing finished comics for the first time, since I love art. I decided to drop Brevia, because I weighed what I valued most, which are my determination to continue improving my artistic abilities and reach out to audiences in a format I know well, building my self-confidence through performance and trying new things, and staying healthy throughout college. Even though I am saddened I cannot do all of the activities I want to do, I have no regrets for the ones I chose.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[There are several concerns in the FOP trip scenario described, but the three that concern me the most are the social behaviors seen with Renee, Kelly, and Phillip. 
Firstly, I am worried for Renee. If I were a FOP Leader, I would notice right away how unresponsive she has become, and how she is no longer talking with Lizzie and Matilda. She does not deserve to feel excluded because she has a different background than the other FOPpers, and she should not feel depressed at any point on the trip either. In order to alleviate the situation, I would try to include Matilda in conversations again. During hikes, I would purposely place Matilda, Lizzie, and Renee nearest to me. When Matilda and Lizzie begin to engage in conversation about their personal histories, I would try to change the subject, either bringing up favorite foods or movies or some other aspect that Renee can possibly relate to. If Renee still cannot reenter the conversation and she still feels isolated, I would try talking to her more, asking her questions that require more than a one or two word response such as about what concentration she is thinking of studying in, or how she feels about being on the trail, anything to avoid talking about her background since she is unhappy with that kind of conversation. If needed, I would take her aside after we set up camp to talk in private about what is bothering her. No one should feel excluded from the rest of the group.
Secondly, I am concerned for Kelly. She is shivering, but claims she is fine. While it seems courteous that she does not want to make the FOP Leaders worried, it worries me that she refuses to take care of herself. I am well aware that the Leaders ensure everyone has enough layers to last for cold and windy weather over the week of hiking before anyone leaves the Harvard campus. Therefore, I would politely but seriously ask her to put on an extra layer, because pneumonia or any other illness is not fun to have on a fun hiking and camping trip.
Lastly, Phillip could be a potential problem because of his attitude towards the others on the trip. By listening to his comments it’s clear that he sees himself on a pedestal, he looks down on everyone else because he thinks he is more mature after spending a gap year away from home. I want to make him realize that although he’s had very unique experiences traveling around Australia and Greece, he needs to appreciate the opinions and the interests of those around him and learn to get along with the rest of the FOPpers. I might try reordering the group lineup when hiking so that he is not next to either Peter or me, that way he will be forced to talk to the other pre-frosh. I don’t want to confront him on his attitude towards the others in the group because it is not entirely necessary to establish negative vibes in the group, but I will try to promote more group activities during the night after the hikes or in the morning right before the hikes. That way, he is forced to learn a little bit more about everyone and will become slightly more integrated into the group.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[-	I’m not sure if this counts as a teaching/ leadership experience, but I definitely consider it valuable to my development:
o	The summer of my Freshman year (2010) I babysat an eight year-old for five weeks, all day, five days a week
o	He was probably the most agreeable/ fun eight year-old I’ve ever met, and actually made the summer pretty fun – but the experience is definitely something I refer back on, even now


-	Last year, I was president of my high school (a boarding school where I live, year round, in Central N.H.)
o	It’s something I’m really, really thankful for – definitely, it was the most demanding leadership experience I’ve had (running weekly student-leader meetings, leading a portion of our weekly assemblies, finding stolen bikes, getting apple juice back in the juice machine…) – it was essentially influential, and helpful, to my development as a person

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Having twice been a frightened and uncertain freshman headed into the woods on an orientation hike, and having twice trekked out with a renewed sense of place and excitement, I’m a full believer in the wonders that FOP can work. Having twice led (with adults, per school policy) other students on similar trips, I’ve found the experience on “the other side of the trail” equally enjoyable, and doubly rewarding. The hikes have been transformative; they, and other trips I did while in high school, are without question the best experiences I’ve had. Taking, and eventually leading, these trips gave me an important outlet in which to pursue my own fondness and appreciation for the outdoors and, hopefully, help others to do the same. Having spent the entirety of my pre-college life in the mountains of Central N.H., I guess it’s somewhat “natural” that I really enjoy just being outside, and I hope that some of that love would rub off on any FOPpers that I had. Bustling metropolis that it is, Holderness, N.H., offers surprisingly little in the way of indoor entertainment – so, I got comfortable in the woods, really, because I had to be, because I was always there with my friends. I think I could help FOPpers with most outdoor-related issues they might encounter and, with memories fresh of standing in their boots, help them feel comfortable otherwise, too. While I have tons to learn myself, I think I could help create, or at least aim toward, a FOP experience as positive as my own.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think the main challenges for me in leading a FOP group would be these: making the FOPpers feel comfortable not only about our time in the woods, but also their upcoming fall at Harvard, and creating enough of a relationship with each of them to be a resource once back on campus. My leaders did all of this beautifully for me, so I know it’s possible, but I have no doubts as to its difficulty. Creating a fun environment is one thing, but building a safe one, one in which the entire group can feel relaxed and welcome with the Fall looming, is another entirely. The groups are big, and while I think it can ultimately make the trips more fun, it would make it a little trickier to get to know everyone as well as I’d like in such a short period of time. Ideally, we’d all reach the point where I could be equally helpful in the front country as in the back – what was once knot instruction could turn into flannel/ vest advice back in the city.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[To pee, or not to pee. That, truly, was the question. Memories of sweet-smelling sheets and fuzzy fleece pj’s all too fresh in my hatted head, I rolled my frosty sleeping bag on its side and opened the face guard, synched down to a quarter-sized hole in my few hours of sleep. In poured nature’s icy breath, sending me reeling, but I inched my neck back up and stared out at the sheet of snow. Grit on grit, we laid locked in a battle of wills. The resolve of my frozen foe seemed unwavering, and my bladder was not itself mute, but neither was my head to be deterred. The perils of the nighttime cold I knew full well; the sleeping bag’s case seemed infinitely stronger (and warmer) than that of my lower half. But try as I might to fall back, deeply, into dreamland, sleep would not come. Here entered my two consciences: “be prescient,” said the one. “You know you’ll feel better after you go!” “Pssh,” said the other. “C’mon, stay. Why leave the bag? You’re not gonna’ find warmth out there!” Soon, though, I came to the point where, exhausted by my indecision, I could hold it no longer, and scrambled out into the woods with headlamp in hand. As the angel of foresight cheered in victory, I came to a clearing, a frozen pond, where a clear sky and a lifetime’s worth of stars painted a picture I keep in my mind to this day. And, of course, I fell back asleep, warmer than ever.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Foremost on my list of concerns would be ensuring that the group could feel friendly as a whole, and not just in smaller, individual pods. It seems, at least from the write-up, that the FOPpers are getting along well, but are somewhat exclusive in their friendships, and that the subject matter of their conversations can be alienating. While I’m not sure of the extent to which group leaders can explicitly steer conversation away from personal adventures that might make other FOPpers feel isolated, a game of “contact” or “initials” that involved everyone on the trail could go a long way toward building group identity. Something that my leaders used was having us walk next to someone new after every break, and it was really effective. Peter’s idea of having the FOPpers set up the tarps in teams is a great one, and maybe the groups could be ones that didn’t necessarily include the closest friendship pairs – not to discourage the closest friendships (that’s the best part of FOP!), but just to make the group as inclusive as it could be.

His idea is also effective in addressing another of my concerns: making sure camp is set up before dark. After just two camp set-ups, it could be tough to tie up the tarps with just headlamps. Pulling a ridgeline in the dark would no doubt be tougher, and the other lines might not be as tight come any nighttime rain. I think Peter’s plan is a good one; the competition aspect would certainly help me work faster, and having a leader with each group would definitely make things move more quickly. If it was getting really dark, though, I might have one of the leaders take some more experienced FOPpers and set up the tarps while the other worked on dinner with the rest of the group.

My last concern would be about Kelly. I completely trust her and the others to know their own bodies, and I would definitely believe her when she said she was full at meals. I would, however, try to be as aware of the situation as I could, and be especially cognizant of her shivering at breaks. Maybe I’d offer up another fleece layer to the whole group, so she could accept it and not feel singled out. If things got to the point where I and the other leader felt she was eating unhealthily little, I might ask her to come fill up water bottles at camp and have a conversation about the trip so far: how she’s doing, what she likes, what she doesn’t. Maybe it could make her feel more comfortable, or isolate the issue if there is one. Again, I trust her to be healthy, but I would just try to be as on top of the situation as I could, and keep on the same page with my other leader as much as possible.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I am a genuine person. This can mean a lot of different things, but I mean it as I am a good friend. In my opinion, a good friend is someone who you can be yourself around. So I am there to listen to my friend’s worries and struggles. Sometimes I offer helpful advice, when appropriate, or just give a hug and lend a shoulder to cry on when that’s all I can contribute. I know how important it is to have someone to talk through problems with, and I am comfortable assuming that role. I also am a friend who loves to laugh and have fun, and if I learned anything from my FOP trip was how important having fun was! Playing games after lunch and word games on the trail are my favorite. FOP, as a program, embraces the dichotomy between seriousness and hilarity and I think that I do as well. The FOP leaders are responsible for setting the tone of the trip and also of the different exercises. I am capable of creating a healthy balance between having fun during the day, but also making sure that the evening activities are taken seriously. Another huge part of being a FOP leader is being part of a team, with the co-leader and also the FOPpers. I know that I can work well with other people and help my co-leader and the FOPpers feel supported throughout the trip. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>On a spectrum from thoughtful to extroverted I fall on more thoughtful side. However, I know from being a camp counselor and JA that when I am in the role of being a leader, I step outside of my comfort zone and work hard to be engaging and fun. I think that being a good listener and reflective sometimes on FOP is okay and even necessary. As a leader, it is important to be approachable by all types of people. So my tendency towards thoughtfulness will help me connect with the more introverted FOPpers. I think the most important time to be outgoing is the first night when we stay in the dorm. This was the hardest night for me, because you don't know anyone in your group and homesickness starts to set in. It is important to be outgoing when with the entire group, but then in the one-on-one meetings that night, in order to connect with the FOPpers, being calm and engaging is better so they feel they can talk to you. So even though I am quieter than some people, I think that it can be a strength because the FOPpers will be all over the spectrum, and they need to have leaders with whom they can relate.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Senior year of high school, a couple of my close friends were caught drinking in the dorm. They were suspended and stripped of their leadership roles. When they returned from suspension I was faced with the decision of how to treat them. They had betrayed not only the schools trust, but mine. I hold myself to very high standards and expect my friends to do the same. I know that it isn’t completely fair to expect so much of my friends, but I want them to be their best selves. When they returned they were sad, embarrassed and unhappy at the school. I saw two ways to treat them, the first would be to tell them they had lost my trust and be harsh on them. But that wasn't a good decision because they were already being severe on themselves. The second option was to forgive and support them in their growth process after making a bad decision. It sounds cheesy but everyone does make bad choices and I had to look beyond the one bad move to accept them and see their overall qualities. I ultimately did just that and helped them work through their anger at the school (which was misplaced, as they did break a rule) and restart their senior years on a clean slate.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first move would be to ask Kelly, in private, how she’s doing. I would ask her to come with me to scout out a critter line, help me with the cooking, or some other task, so I could get her by herself. I would then mention that I have noticed her shivering and ask her how she’s doing. I wouldn’t take “Fine, I just need to keep hiking,” as an answer and maybe suggest that she go to sleep early so she can get some extra rest. I would also offer her one of my layers to wear while hiking so she can stay warm. After talking to Kelly in private and figuring out how she’s doing, I would talk about it with Peter. He may decide that she’s fine or maybe we would alert Base Camp to her symptoms. 

My second person to reach out to would be Renee. I don't want her FOP experience to be defined by one lousy conversation. I also don't want her to feel like she doesn’t belong to our group because of her upbringing. I might ask her to help me with the cooking or something so we can talk. I would check in with her about how things are going with Lizzie and Matilda. Maybe say, “I see you and Lizzie and Matilda are not hanging out as much as you used to,” or something along those lines. Then if she opens up to me, I would offer her my advice, “Don't let their upbringings define your relationship with them. They may not even know that they are hurting your feelings.” Depending on her response, if she’s just jealous of the trips they’ve taken, I would say, “Even though they've gone on all of these trips and had a great life on paper, its only half of the story. There’s no way to know the struggles they’ve been through in life and maybe they traveled a lot, but there could be a lot of other issues in their life.” If Renee isn't jealous but maybe something deeper is going on that I didn’t pick up on, then I would try my best to support her and maybe tell her to try talking with some other FOPpers, like Kelly.

Then I would address Daniel. I would politely remind Daniel that FOP is not the place to plan parties for when we return to campus. I would try to remind him that we are on FOP to form relationships and maybe he should try hiking with some other FOPpers to get to know them better. In order to facilitate this I might make hiking pairs or start a game that we can play.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I’ve been leading various groups/athletic teams for most of my life. As captain of three varsity sports teams, I was given the responsibility to inspire, control, and push my teammates to be bot the best athletes and people that they could be while contributing as much as possible to the team. As a leader, I try to appear confident in order to inspire confidence in those around me. If I were to become a FOP leader, I would act with conviction to instill self-assurance in my FOPers to break out of their shells, just as my leaders helped me. I also, believe I am very approachable and friendly as to make those around me feel welcomed and comfortable. Through my FOP trip, I learned just how great it feels to be in a group of people that genuinely enjoy your company. I want every FOPer to experience that same sense of community and I hope to do so by leading a trip of my own. Furthermore, on campus I am involved in a pretty solid variety of clubs. I write for SatireV, play club volleyball, and am a part of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. I am also planning to concentrate in mechanical engineering here. Because of my variety of academic and extracurricular interests and my desire to pursue mechanical engineering, I think I would be a valuable resource for first-year students to learn about the variety of concentrations and opportunities available to them at Harvard.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think my greatest weakness is my need to control situations. I am very strong in my opinions of how things should be done and become rather frustrated when they turn out differently. Leading a group of younger students, it could get difficult to overcome this sense of control for the betterment of the group as a whole. That being said, my ability to be open to other's ideas has improved dramatically since I have arrived at Harvard, and being more aware of this tendency has helped me avoid conflict this semester, especially with my roommates and fellow SAE pledges. I think that the pure joy of being in the backcountry again would help me to loosen up a bit and take life one step at a time. Besides my stubborn mindset, I think another challenge is an honest lack of experience in the backcountry. I loved my FOP trip, but apart from a few isolated experiences, I do not have all that much history in the woods. I think I could gain the necessary skills from FOP’s training, but as of now this would be one of my biggest challenges in leading a group of first-years on FOP. As of now, I would not be able to cope with all of the emergencies that could arise on the backcountry.

		<Q7.4>This past year, my uncle, suffering from cancer, was in the hospital. My parents were planning a trip to visit him and warned me about his current state. I was swamped with schoolwork and extra curricular activities that day, so my parents told me I could visit him later on that week if I needed time to work. I had to decide if I was emotionally ready to see my uncle in such a fragile state and if this was the best time to take the trip. My uncle was an incredibly strong man, and I looked up to him. It would crush me to see him restricted to a hospital bed. I also knew that if I made the trip to the hospital I would miss a sports practice and likely not finish my homework that was due the next day. Ultimately, I made the choice to visit my uncle: to put my family in front of myself and to suppress my fears. Unfortunately, My uncle ended up passing away later that night. I was lucky enough to get to the hospital, along with my parents and my grandmother, in time to say our final goodbyes to him. In some of his last moments, my uncle spoke directly to me and gave me some of the most powerful advice I have received. Had I decided to push my visit to the hospital back to a later date, I would have lived the rest of my life regretting that day. </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[1) The first concern that comes up is the exclusivity that Matilda and Lizzie present. It is wonderful that the two girls seem to be hitting it off with each other and it is always great to encourage new friendships, but the end goal is to have an entire FOP group that is incredibly close. By secluding themselves in hiking order and conversation, Lizzie and Matilda are closing themselves off to the rest of the group. This becomes an even more severe problem for Renee because she may feel like she identifies most closely from Matilda and Lizzie, but if even she is cut off from their conversation, then she may become very lonely on the trip. This goes against FOP’s principles of including all members in all activities. It is important to try and separate Lizzie and Matilda and make sure they are conversing just as much with the other FOPer’s as they are with each other. 

2) The next concern comes from Phillip. Phillip may be older than some of the other FOPer’s but this does not put him above his peers. The way he ignores Daniel’s obvious pleas for friendship show that Phillip holds an opinion of himself as a bit higher than those around him. To solve this problem, I would talk to Peter and make sure he too understands the situation. We both will then still interact with Phillip in a well-mannered way, but at the same time, try to include other FOPer’s in our conversations to try and show Phillip that he has things in common with his classmates. The most important part is to put Phillip on the same level as the rest of the group and to make him understand that on FOP, no one person is better or worse than the rest. 

3) The final, most serious concern is Kelly. Intelligent people often have a difficult time admitting problems. Due to her shaking and giving away of food, it is evident that there is something of concern happening to Kelly. FOPer’s are under a lot of fatigue and physical stress throughout the hike and need to get plenty of nourishment and comfort in their off time. However, this is also a very fragile topic. You do not want to single out and embarrass Kelly by pointing out her eating habits. To try and take on this problem, I would continuously ask the entire group to make sure there are no injuries or problems. Then, throughout the day, press Kelly more closely to make sure she is feeling safe and healthy. If she does not respond to the initial requests, I would attempt to hike next to her throughout the day and try to get her to talk to me in complete confidentiality. I hope that by that point in the trip, my FOPer’s would have gained the confidence to confide in me their concerns.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[-August 2012: FOP C backpacking trip (while unsure when choosing what level trip to sign up for, I was up for a challenge) and absolutely loved every minute of it, despite being one of the slower trip participants, falling downhill the first day, and getting stung profusely by a sea of wasps. Because of the issues I faced so early on during the trip, I made myself vulnerable and opened up a space where others felt comfortable sharing their stories. While shy in the beginning, I quickly loosened up and connected with all the members in my group by starting lots of different conversations and seeing what topics resonated with the other people on my trip.

While I am an outdoorsy person, I do not have much experience in the backcountry but am so excited to explore it more! I grew up enjoying long bike rides and walks and playing competitive tennis, including in the hot, summer Florida sun. I believe being in the backcountry allows people to disconnect and interact with others in a way that is special. Despite my limited experience in the backcountry, I do have significant experience dealing with challenging situations and I excel in circumstances where I am out of my comfort zone. Taking time to leave electronics and everything but yourself behind to enjoy one another’s company and embark on a challenging journey offers so much opportunity for growth and excitement.
]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[In high school, I tutored Middle School students in both math and Latin which was a very rewarding experience. In high school I was also co-captain of my high school’s tennis team two consecutive years where I made it my duty to make sure the new team members quickly acclimated to the team. I received the sportsmanship award both years. I also was an active participant of student government in high school my junior and senior years and vice president of my school senior year. Some of my initiatives included running a fall pep rally so other sports teams could get the recognition the winter teams received and co-heading TIGERewards, a 10% discount card to neighborhood joints as a way to benefit both the student body and the local shops. I was voted by my classmates to be one of two graduation speakers.

At Harvard, I tutored and mentored a student last year through PBHA’s Mission Hill after school tutoring program. I am very involved in the business board of Hasty Pudding Theatricals, a group on campus that puts on an annual musical burlesque almost entirely student run. On business board, I have become very comfortable working with others, finding ways to make sure everyone is happy and coming up with creative ways to solve problems. Much of my efforts are focused on selling and bartering advertisements, selling tickets, and now as finance manager, where I keep track of the expenses going in and out of the company and am responsible for reconciliation each month. I am also very involved with Kappa Kappa Gamma and am taking on the leadership position of recording secretary this year. Lastly, I volunteer at Harvard Square Homeless Shelter where I get the opportunity to interact with the guests there and hear their stories.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[After not being accepted as a FOP leader last year, I decided to take up the offer to get feedback on my FOP interview which, while a bit difficult to take in at first, has helped me tremendously in all aspects of my life.

I would like to now discuss some ways I have addressed the feedback I was given after my FOP interview last year. The first point the steering committee mentioned was my weak pedagogical skills in my interview. Last semester, while tutoring at Mission Hill Afterschool Program, I made a concerted effort to not just give away answers but to help my tutee reach that answer with a little bit of guidance. I helped him come up with mnemonic devices and asked him questions that forced him to think through the problems he faced. This year, I am in Stat 110 and work with a pset group weekly. Whenever helping the group with a particular question, I try hard again to not give the answer away but to guide the group to reach the answer on their own. Last summer, I worked at a startup and at a tennis camp. While working at the startup, I helped my bosses, all of whom are Israeli, understand American culture in many different ways. In Israel, my bosses were used to being overly aggressive. I taught them how to strike a balance between being pushy and giving the customer time and space. In Israel, my bosses were accustomed to striking a friendly relationship with customers in a number of ways, one of which includes becoming Facebook friends. I taught them that this could be seen as creepy in the US. At tennis camp, I worked with young kids at a beginner level. I struggled with keeping them enthused about playing tennis all day. I came up with strategies that got their attention such as playing games involving prizes or placing the tennis game into a scenario that resonated with them, such as watching a mouse (the ball) approaching them and smacking it to the other side of the net, similar to stories my dad used when teaching me the sport. 
Another piece of feedback I received was that I could have been more assertive in my interview, especially during the mock backcountry scenario. Last year, I was a little shy and held back a bit. After realizing that my shyness often got in the way, I have made an effort to be more assertive. To successfully complete the Hasty Pudding Theatricals comp for business staff, I realized I needed to be more assertive and make sure the current business staff knew what I had accomplished during the comp. This effort helped me successfully join the business staff. In addition, at the startup I worked at over the summer, I became very comfortable asserting myself because that was the culture of the company I walked into. Not only did I enjoy being assertive but I realized I gained the respect of my bosses and potential investors I spoke with when doing so and also gained greater confidence. 
The third piece of feedback I received was to try to speak more on my leadership presence. I think one reason I had so much trouble answering this question in the interview last year is because I take pride in being modest and allowing every team member’s strengths to shine (some of that comes from being a twin). This presence helped me with my leadership positions at Hasty Pudding Theatricals and Kappa Kappa Gamma. 
One piece I would add is that it can take me time to warm up to new situations and environments but once I do, I thrive. When applying to kindergarten at the school I got accepted to and attended all the way through twelfth grade, I had to go back for my interview on three different occasions because the first two times, after being taken into a room with my interviewer without my parents, I grew very uncomfortable, started crying, and asked my interviewer to take me back to my parents. On the third time, my interviewer let my mom sit in the back of the room while she interviewed me. I got accepted and thrived at this school, despite my shyness and discomfort in the beginning. This is representative of my time at Harvard thus far. It took me a good portion of freshman year to figure everything out but now I am in a very comfortable place and feel that I am confident in and knowledgeable about any situation I face whether it’s going to meet with my professor, entering the dining hall by myself and sitting with people I don’t know very well, or calling my friend out (in a constructive way) when he/she says something I disagree with. One thing that is definitely different about me this year from last is that I have come to love discomfort, being put in awkward situations and figuring out how to handle them in the moment.

		<Q7.1>1</Q7.1>
		<Q7.2>I am sympathetic to the fear and excitement that accompanies freshman year, whether enrolling in a difficult course or deciding to attend an event by myself. I am still exploring different interests of mine and prioritize meeting new people which is crucial freshman year. I have greatly improved at dealing with new situations and have much wisdom to give to incoming freshmen, such as the importance of realizing most people feel the same fear when entering new situations, being prepared and putting oneself out there. I am in a position to both relate to as well as offer advice to the incoming freshmen as I have had a lot of time to think about freshman year at Harvard. I also love Harvard and have so many fond memories to share that I know will get incoming freshmen even more excited about their upcoming year. 

I love and am very good at viewing situations from many different lenses and making sure everyone feels comfortable and included. I often over think situations which makes me hyper-aware and sensitive to the way others around me feel. I am very good at connecting with and relating to many different people. I also love connecting others by pointing out similarities or differences they share or providing a conversation starter. I am quick on my toes and love coming up with creative ways to solve problems. I have strong communication skills having worked on them since birth as a twin, and stay calm and positive in stressful situations.
</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I am naturally a bit shy when placed in new environments and can take a bit to warm up. I think that if anything, this weakness is something many can relate to and sharing this weakness with incoming freshmen could be very reassuring to them as they are about to be in a place away from home knowing a minimal amount of people. As with my own FOP group, opening up about my shyness and insecurities will help my group of freshmen open up.

I love befriending anyone I meet and getting on the same level as others. While striking a friendship of some sort is crucial to gaining the trust and respect of each individual person on the trip, I am sensitive that there will be times that I need to take charge and be the leader. I think an important role for co-leaders is to make sure that we are balancing these friendship/mentorship roles effectively. I look forward to receiving and giving feedback on issues like this with my co-leader(s). 
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Last year I faced a tough decision in the blocking process. We were a group of eight, then five, then three (If you would really like to know this whole story, let’s grab coffee). Because we could not enter our house lottery as a group of three, it got to the point where one of us would have to find another group to live with. After mulling it over for a while, I volunteered. At that time, I felt I was the most outgoing one and most comfortable in new situations around new people. I thought that on the plus side, I would have the opportunity to meet new people and had a strong hunch that my new living group and I would end up in the same building as the members of my blocking group. I also thought it was not that big of a deal and would work out in the end. Freshman year, I was on a mission to constantly challenge myself, which is probably how I ended up on a FOP C trip with some Varsity athletes.
In retrospect, while I have enjoyed getting to know my new roommates and having a single, I can’t help thinking about some other factors I could have considered. My two other blockmates and I could have abstained from entering the lottery and hoped a triple opened up- I did not realize how much is still undecided after the lottery. We also could have done things very differently at the beginning of the blocking process.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The first step is to always have a chat with my co-leader. It is so crucial that Peter and I are both on the same page and work as a team. In order to avoid taking the wrong path that was taken the day before, in our meeting I would urge us to take a few more breaks the next day to make sure we are taking the right trails, especially since we have a lot of distance to cover. And the extra breaks won’t hurt the group. I would then like to discuss how he thinks our group is doing, how the trip is going, and how everyone is getting along.
	I would also focus on bringing the whole group back together. While I am happy that Lizzie and Matilda are getting along well, I would want to find ways to get the whole group involved in conversation with them so that everyone can get the most out of the trip. Perhaps instead of discussing vacations, I could start a conversation asking others where they would like to travel. This not only continues the conversation Lizzie and Matilda were so engaged in but also brings others into the conversation who previously did not participate, including Renee. Because it seems like a lot of people in the group are starting to break off into little groups, I would try to play some group games to bring everyone together. We could play I Spy games, movie guessing games or sing songs. Another idea I have to bring the group together is to assign people to particular spots in line. I would especially want to place Phillip away from Peter so that he is forced to interact with others as well as separate Daniel from Phillip so that he can hopefully get to know more people. I would then want to place Kelly and Jack next to more extroverted people who can initiate conversations with them. Perhaps I would also stand near these two to help facilitate conversation between them and others. I would want to separate Suzy from Mark so that she gets a chance to meet others in the group and not just cling to Mark. 
	Another thing I would want to do is have quick individual check-ins with everyone to see how each person is doing. This idea allows each person to express any concerns he/she has in a non-threatening environment and also give feedback on what is working. I would once again like to ask Kelly if she is okay due to her shivering during breaks and make sure she is getting enough food, since I have also noticed that she has been giving away some of her snacks to others. Not only is it crucial to connect with Peter but also to connect with all the FOPpers. I would also ask them if there is anyone they would like to get to know more and if there is anything specific about Harvard they would like to talk about as a group at some point. Addressing these three concerns will create group unity and allow my co-leader and I to better understand and get to know each member which will be crucial to the duration of the trip!

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[I don’t have much prior outdoor experience, other than my own FOP trip and occasional day-hikes with friends. However, I remember coming back to campus at the beginning of my first year feeling so happy and lucky to have gone on FOP, and with a new thirst to acquaint myself better with the outdoors. I loved the detachment from frontcountry life, sleeping under the stars and waking up to the smell of trees, and even using nature as a bathroom. Contact with the outdoors is something that I’ve unfortunately been missing in my life, and watching my own amazing FOP leaders (with their comfort and knowledge of backcountry life) made me envious and wishful that I could soon be like that. I know that becoming a FOP leader would help me to develop as a person in ways that would acquaint me with the outdoors in order to be able to go on trips on my own and explore for myself what I’ve been missing, aside from just FOP-related trips.]]></Q6.1>

-From 8th-12th grade, I tutored underclassmen in math, chemistry, Spanish, and Latin at my high school.
-During the summers of 10th and 11th grade, I was captain of my Junior Olympic softball team.
-My first year at Harvard, I served as Fundraising Chair for the women’s rugby team, and was responsible for finding ways to fund a lot of our travels and endeavors.
-Now, I’m social chair of the women’s rugby team.
-This past summer, I biked around New England with a group of 5 previous strangers, building the movement against climate change. We each held different leadership roles, and my specific role was to be in charge of conducting interviews and documenting our entire journey through film.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[In the previous question, I mentioned my biking adventure this past summer, in which I traveled around New England exclusively by bicycle (we took a pledge to travel only by bicycle, no fossil fuels) with a group of 5 strangers, spreading the word and building the movement against climate change. There were a few instances in which we had massive bike problems in the middle of nowhere/far away from enough food or anyone who could help us, and I learned to think quickly and rationally to figure out the best way to get sufficient food and shelter before dark. This often involved splitting our group and delegating specific responsibilities to different people, using each of our individual strengths to maximize the outcome of what we needed to get done (my individual strengths were often either hands-on fixing bike problems, or dealing with frustrated/stressed teammates, as I tended to stay very level-headed). Sometimes our housing plans fell through and we had to improvise last-minute to find a place to stay, so I learned to keep calm and trust my own (and my teammates’) instincts and skills to make everything okay (which reminded me a lot of my own FOP trip and the way my leaders handled sticky situations quite smoothly). From this experience, I developed a lot of group mediation skills, and ways to constructively talk about feelings and frustrations in a productive way. I think the leadership skills I developed from various unexpected catastrophes and dealing with group conflicts have significantly enhanced my ability to lead a FOP trip.]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[As a PAF, I’ve dealt with some nervous first-years that have a million questions that they’re afraid to ask, because it seems to them like everyone else has it together, and that they’re alone in feeling intimidated or scared. I did everything I could to be as approachable as possible and help show them in those first few scary weeks that they weren’t alone, and that they could come to me with anything at all without fear of judgment. Some of the more nervous ones have told me how lucky they feel to have gotten me as a PAF, because of the comfortable space I make for them where they really do believe I care about their feelings (which I do! I love talking about feelings). I think that these interpersonal skills will be my strengths in leading a group of first-year students—I love forming deep connections and really getting to know people, and doing anything I can to make people feel comfortable. Also, I remember during my own FOP trip’s Fuzzy Cheesecake, other FOPpers told me that my positive attitude helped to keep them motivated when they were feeling down about their abilities to keep going. Hopefully, if I become a FOP leader, this positive attitude could help first-years stay motivated and find the drive to keep going, even if they are tired and feel overwhelmed. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think that my greatest challenge will be my lack of knowledge or experience with the outdoors. My own FOP trip was the first time I had ever done anything really outdoorsy, and I haven’t done much more since then. In order to be able to successfully lead first-years who may have had no prior experience with the wilderness, I’ll need to become a backcountry expert. However, I’m definitely more than willing to put in the time and effort I know will be necessary to prepare myself to be able to safely lead first-years through the backcountry. FOP gave me a newfound love for backpacking and the outdoors, which is one of the reasons I want to become a leader so badly—I hope to be able to make some first-years love the outdoors the same way that my leaders did for me.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[For years, softball had consumed my life, and was all I thought or cared about. Then my junior year, I took a class called Facing History and Ourselves that sparked my interest in human rights and social justice issues. I was given the opportunity over April break to take a trip to Europe and see firsthand a lot of the things we learned about. I knew this trip would mean a lot to me, but it would make me miss two softball games and thus lose my starting position on the Varsity team.

On one hand, if I missed a few games and forfeited my starting position, I would be letting down my team and myself. On the other hand, however, I knew I would never get an opportunity like this again to experience so much of the history I had been learning about firsthand. I struggled a lot with this decision, and after discussing it with my parents, friends, and guidance counselor, I decided to go on the trip. Softball was important to me, but that passion would likely end after high school, since I wasn’t playing in college. My passion for human rights and social justice, however, could be a lifelong passion, and this trip could facilitate the beginnings of it. I knew I was being slightly selfish, but I wanted to do what was best for my own future interests. My teammates all understood, and were very supportive. I now know that I made the right decision.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern is Kelly, and the fact that she is shivering while hiking and giving away a lot of her food—if there’s something going on that makes her uncomfortable / not eat, I believe I should talk to her about that. I would first talk to Peter and see if he has noticed the same thing, and see what he thinks we should do about it. I would tell him that I want to talk  to her and see what’s going on; I realize that this is potentially an uncomfortable topic, so rather than accusing her or making assumptions, I’ll start by just asking her about the trip and her feelings/experiences with it in general. After I’m hopefully able to get her to open up a bit, I can mention that I’ve noticed she’s not eating a lot, and that I just want to make sure everything’s okay with her. I would bring up the shivering again and tell her that though she says she’s fine, it still concerns me, and that if she needs us to slow down the pace or something I can make it happen subtly.

Another concern is that Renee seems to be feeling isolated from Lizzie and Matilda, because of their different backgrounds. It’s great that Lizzie and Matilda are connecting, but I want to make sure that Renee also feels included in conversation. I would bring this up with Peter to see how we could address it. Perhaps the two of us could make an active effort to make conversation on the trail that is more inclusive, about something accessible to everyone, like life at Harvard. If this doesn’t work, we could play trail games like Contact, so everyone’s included and it has nothing to do with different backgrounds. If none of this works, I can try talking to Renee, and ask her how she’s doing/feeling about group dynamics. If she voices any concerns, I can talk to her about things I can do to help her feel more comfortable.

A third concern is the fact that Peter led us down the wrong trail. A half-mile off course is definitely not the worst thing that could happen, but I want to make sure this doesn’t lead to other avoidable mistakes that could potentially have worse consequences on the group. I would talk to Peter about this in a way that is non-confrontational, and makes it very clear that I am not blaming him but just want to help prevent future mistakes. I could suggest we both map out each day’s routes together, so we can keep a check on each other if we’re leading off trail. This could carry over into other aspects of co-leading, too; it’s better to have both of us in on making a decision, and hopefully having a talk like this would facilitate future conversations about making decisions together and keeping each other in check.

		<Q6.1>June 2011: 5 day camping trip in Acadia national park with 10 friends.  We spent the time hiking around the park, and participating in volunteer service projects such as trail blazing and trail beautification.
July 2012: 3 day hike on the Appalachian Trail.  I was one of two counselors overseeing a group of 8 thirteen year-old boys on the hike.  I helped cook meals, set up camp, and lead activities while hiking.
</Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[As a freshman and sophomore in high school I tutored several middle school students in math (mostly unpaid). 
The summer after my junior year in high school I was a counselor at a traditional YMCA summer camp.  I was placed in charge of a cabin of 13 year old boys, and was charged with designing activities for them and looking after their physical and emotional well-being.  I also taught baseball and soccer classes during that summer.  I taught skills, and then created activities to reinforce the skills while also having fun.
As a junior and senior I participated in my school’s official Peer Tutoring program, which involved tutoring multiple underclassmen, while also participating in a weekly seminar on teaching and learning styles.  As a peer tutor I was also responsible for training the younger tutors.
As a senior I was one of two head delegates for my school’s Model UN team.  I was not only responsible for organizing the logistical aspects of the team’s travel and lodging, but much more importantly for training the freshman and teaching them the necessary skills to be competitive delegates.  I ran workshops to help with public speaking, writing and other aspects of the activity.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think that one of my greatest strengths leading a FOP trip would be my sense of humor and general positive energy.  I am a naturally goofy guy, and I think my energy is usually infectious in a group setting.  People usually feel very comfortable and relaxed with me because I don’t take myself overly seriously, and I’m always eager to engage others.  I think that my energy and my enthusiasm would help to relax and distract FOPpers who are having trouble with the physical aspects of the hike, or are feeling homesick.  As I mentioned before, I have specific experience with entertaining people while hiking and camping, so I know it’s something I’m capable of.  Aside from being funny, I’m very enthusiastic and energetic; I’m always eager to whole-heartedly throw myself into any game or activity.  That being said, I’m also very capable of being serious when the situation calls for it.  I’m very empathetic, and always willing to help someone who’s having a hard time.  Finally, I have a fair amount of experience with hiking and camping, and I think I would be fully capable of passing on the relevant skills to FOPpers.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think that one of my greatest challenges in leading a FOP trip would be making sure that I attend to each FOPper equally.  I could imagine a situation where I got very caught up in a discussion with one first-year on the trail, and therefore didn’t engage with as many FOPpers as possible. To avoid that problem I would have to constantly check in with myself (no pun intended) to ensure that I was circulating among the various FOPpers.  I also worry that I might find it difficult to maintain my energy over six days.  I would probably have to find a way to effectively and efficiently recharge so that I’m able to be a positive force throughout the entirety of the trip.  Finally, I think that as a first-year FOP leader I might have trouble always asserting an air of confidence when teaching skills to the FOPpers.  Many of the most important FOP skills are new to me, and even if I’m not fully sure of myself, it would still be important for me to be self-assured when passing on the expertise to FOPpers.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One of my classes this semester offers students the option to either take a final exam or write a research paper.  I had to choose which grading option I would select in the middle of the semester, and I struggled with the decision for quite a while.  I knew that writing the research paper would cause me to engage with the subject matter of the course in a more serious and profound manner, but at the same time a final exam would ensure that I reviewed and reinforced the material I had learned during the semester.  I also knew that a research paper would require me to plan and prepare well before reading period, while my studying for a final exam could be contained to a smaller period of time.  I ended up making my decision on the basis of what I would be doing for my other classes during finals.  I already knew that I would be writing two research papers, and only taking one (fairly relaxed) final, so I decided to balance my schedule rather than writing the third paper.  In retrospect I think that I should have valued my academic experience over my workload during reading period.  I should have realized that the process of drafting and researching a paper would cause me to be more engaged in the class during the final weeks of the semester, whereas a final might lead to cramming.  That being said, the balance in my schedule has without a doubt led to a more relaxed reading period.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern is Kelly’s health.  Any type of physical issue is a top priority, and if Kelly is developing a cold or is having trouble keeping up with the physical demands of the trip, that has the potential to have a devastating effect on her FOP experience.  It sounds like she might not be eating enough and is definitely not always dressed warmly enough.  I would make sure that Kelly is always wearing plenty of layers whenever the group is in camp or hiking during the morning or evening.  I would also discourage her from giving away her food during meals, because she needs to be full replenished for a long day of hiking.  I would check in with her periodically during the hike to make sure she’s handling the physical aspects of the hike well.  I also want her to more fully integrate into the group, and would encourage her to do so by putting her in small groups with some of the more social FOPpers.  Perhaps she could help fill up water bottles with Mark and one of the leaders.  The small group setting might encourage her to be more outgoing and branch out of her comfort zone.
My second concern in the dynamic that’s developing between Lizzie, Matilda, and Renee.  First of all, I wouldn’t want Lizzie and Matilda (who seem to have remarkably similar upbringings) to close themselves off to the rest of the group by bonding exclusively with each other.  Additionally, I don’t want Renee to think that expensive European vacations are a prerequisite for social acceptance at Harvard.  Lizzie and Matilda should always be separated for group games and activities, such as setting up the tarps, and whenever they discuss polarizing topics the FOP leaders should attempt to redirect the conversation towards a more accessible topic.  I would try to bring Renee out of her shell by directing conversations towards topics that I know she’s passionate about, so she can see that other FOPpers share her interests.  I would also put her in a position of leadership and authority during group activities to encourage her interaction with FOPpers.  By asking her to take the lead on setting up a tarp or cooking a meal, Renee would have a great opportunity to interact positively with her fellow FOPpers.
My third and final concern is the developing dynamic between Daniel and Phillip.  I’m worried that Daniel is going to end up being disappointed when it becomes clear that Phillip is not interested in his friendship, and even if a friendship blossoms it will not necessarily be a particularly healthy one.  It seems likely that Phillip would dominate the relationship, and would not necessarily bring out the better angels of Daniel’s nature.  I would want to engage Daniel in activities where he talks about his own interests rather than listening to Phillip’s exploits.  I want the group to become acquainted with Daniel as an individual rather than a follower of Phillip.

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Spring 2014: Co-Department head of Classical Music at WHRB: in the spring, I have been selected as one of two department heads for our department at WHRB. Our responsibilities will include staffing all of our air as well as programming the classical music for the semester.
Fall 2013: Math 1A course assistant: this fall I worked as a course assistant for the intro to calculus class. My responsibilities included attending lectures, holding problem-solving sessions, working in the Math Question Center (MQC), holding office hours, and grading problem sets. During lectures, when students work on problems, I would answer questions and help students work-through the problems.
Fall 2013: co-comp director for the Classical Music Comp at WHRB: this fall I led the comp for my department at WHRB. This entailed holding weekly meetings wherein I taught a brief history lesson of classical music each week. I also handled assessing comp assignments and organizing compers for the end of the year presentation to our department. 
Fall 2012: tutor with Marshall After-school Program: I volunteer for four hours every Tuesday with the Marshall After-school program. Our group goes to Dorchester to the Marshall school and works with third-fifth graders on their homework. I also had the opportunity to create a curriculum around the election to teach the students in a fun and educational way about the recent presidential election.
Winter 2011-2012:  co-captain of the Varsity winter track team: I was a co-captain of a fifty+ member team during the winter track season of my senior year in high school. 
Fall 2011: captain of the Varsity cross country team: I was the only captain of the forty+ member cross country team during my senior year of high school.
2011-2012: elected Elder at Nassau Presbyterian Church: I was an Elder at Nassau Presbyterian Church, one of 27 adults and 3 youth, elected by the 1800+ member congregation to make the governing decisions of the church. I served on the Mission and Outreach Committee. The Session, the governing body of the church on which Elders serve, meets once a month and my committee meets separately to plan the mission and outreach of Nassau Presbyterian Church. As a youth member, I was expected to participate fully in all aspects of the Session and Committee, representing the interests and concerns of the youth of my church.
2011-2012: president of Sports for Kids: Sports for Kids is an organization based in my high school that collects, cleans, refurbishes and donates used sports equipment. I served as the president of this organization during my senior year. In that role, I organized all club events including equipment cleanings, equipment drives, and equipment donations to outside organizations. This involved working with both members of the Princeton High School community and in the greater Princeton area.
Spring 2011 and 2012: co-captain of the Varsity softball team: I was a co-captain of the softball team at my high school my junior and senior year. I helped restructure the team and focus the team on all around fitness, working in some of the exercises which I had learned during my seasons of running.
2010-2011: community service leader for Sports for Kids: As a junior, I was one of two LINC leaders for the community service group. I recruited and coordinated our 15-person volunteer group for weekend equipment cleanings, as well as ran the weekly 1:49 PM Wednesday meetings. I applied for, and received, a Rotary Grant from the Princeton Rotary Club for $200 for the expenses of Sports for Kids. I also maintained the website for Sports for Kids.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[In the past year, I have taken on several leadership roles within the Harvard community. As a course assistant for Math 1A, I have been challenged to answer questions and explain solutions in many different ways. I have learned that each person learns differently and that it is important to approach a problem from several different ways so that a confused student can learn how to solve math problems and apply that same logic to other problems in the future. As a CA, I have also found myself in a position to advise and calm students (especially freshmen) about school and the transition from high school to college. After the first midterm, I had many students in my class ask about how to better prepare and what their expectations could be for future midterms. These questions caused be to think about what I had done freshman year and how I could positively influence my students’ freshman year academically.
As a comp director for the classical music department at WHRB, I had the opportunity to work with not only freshmen but upperclassmen who wanted to join our department. Again, I took on the role of a teacher; each meeting was structured as a lecture about various aspects of becoming a member at WHRB. I also honed my organizational skills, sorting through assignments and giving feedback to my compers. Part of the job of the comp director is to make the department an opening and inviting place. I tried hard to get compers excited about not only joining WHRB but also the CM department; I believe that creating a space where people feel welcome and part of a community is very important and I tried to do so for the new members of the CM department.

		<Q7.2>My greatest strength with leading a group of first-years would be my ability to keep the group organized and focused, during both the setting-up and picking-up of camp, as well as our group discussions at night. I was the captain of three sports teams in high school and know what it is like to get a bunch of teenagers to work together to accomplish a task, especially when everyone is tired and just wants to go back to sleep. During my cross country season, we would have meets where we had to be at the school at 6 am on a Saturday. Our coach was usually late and it would fall on me, as the captain, to organize the equipment and make sure everyone was present and accounted for. I had to be comfortable with delegating tasks to certain teammates while making sure that everyone was contributing to our preparations.
In this past year alone, I have taken on several leadership roles and developed relationships with many of the freshmen which I have led. It is very interesting to see the struggles and insecurities of freshman year from the perspective of an upperclassman. Not only do I feel as though I can sympathize, as many of those struggles and insecurities were ones I faced freshman year, I also feel as though I am in a good position now to give advice and help freshmen through some of their own problems. 
</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think my greatest challenge as a leader would be keeping up the spirits of the FOPpers during the long days of hiking. I have done a lot of hiking in the past and while I love the outdoors and enjoy its beauty, I also understand that hiking for hours on end can not only be physically exhausting, but mentally exhausting as well. It is very easy to be dragged down into the sludge of walking and end up with a very demotivated group, especially if, as a leader, I am also tired and demotivated. To combat this exhaustion, I would take frequent water breaks and play games, like Botticelli, to help keep our group’s minds off of how tired we feel. While FOP is about exploring the outdoors and trying new things, it is ultimately about creating a community that is welcoming and inviting, especially as the start to freshman year can be intimidating. The morale of the FOPpers should be paramount and therefore I would work very hard to make sure that everyone has a fun time.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[This fall, I applied to write for Let’s Go, the HSA-affiliated program which publishes an unofficial guide to Cambridge and Boston. I put a lot of effort into the application and I was very excited at the prospect of getting to write and explore more of Cambridge and Boston over winter break. Ultimately I was offered the job but after much deliberation, I decided to decline their offer.
	Deciding to go home this winter break in lieu of staying in Cambridge was a difficult decision to make. The job as a writer for Let’s Go not only would be a great way to make some money, but it would also have allowed me, as a chemistry concentrator, to get outside of my comfort zone and explore some of my other interests. However, after the grind of sophomore fall, I found myself tired, worn-out, and ready to go home and sleep for a while in my own bed. As difficult as it was, for my own happiness, I decided that it would be much better to use my break as just that.
	It is very difficult to not take advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities Harvard has to offer. Left and right, there is always something more you can be doing, and some people would tell you that you should be doing. However, I think, as I learned here, that sometimes you have to take some time to step back and relax, to get away from the pressures of school.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[In this FOP group, there seems to be a mixture of very outgoing and worldly freshmen and freshmen who are shyer and tend to stay on the sidelines. While obviously some people are more comfortable around strangers, ideally my co-leader, Peter, and I would be able to create an environment where everyone on our trip feels safe and happy.
	That being said, my first concern would be the interesting change in dynamic between the friendships of Lizzie, Matilda, and Renee. While it can be fun to swap stories about their international travels, that can leave some people, especially Renee, feeling left out and unable to relate to the other girls. I think that the best way to address this difficulty would be to have a group discussion about expectations for college; perhaps giving the FOPpers an opportunity to anonymously ask questions would allow Renee to express her concerns in a more private fashion. To me, it seems as though Renee’s concern is that she won’t fit in at Harvard and perhaps perceives because she comes from a small town, she will not be able to relate to others. A group discussion about what the student body at Harvard actually looks like might help stop some of those worries.
	My second concern would be the shy Kelly and Jack. While they seem happy and certainly friendly to each other, it seems as though they do not yet feel comfortable around the others. I would try to fix this by engaging the group in games while we hike. A group game would allow for everyone to get involved and hopefully laugh a little. A group activity like this might not only help Kelly and Jack come out of their shells, but also might help other FOPpers like Philip and Daniel engage. A game would also help keep the FOPpers on more neutral topics, which might help Renee feel more comfortable again. 
	My third concern would be with my co-leader, Peter. Although the mistake in route was unintentional, it seems as though there is a lack of communication between him and myself. Especially with the thunderstorm today and the challenging hike coming up tomorrow, it is important to keep morale high. The competition which Peter created to get camp set up would undoubtedly work with some FOP groups, but based on the dynamics on this trip, it seems inappropriate. I think that Peter and I should have a discussion about what is working and what is not working on this trip; as we both are leaders, it is important that we agree and can come up with a solution that will make leading the trip more fluid. One solution, instead of competing, could be to delegate tasks when it comes to cooking and setting up camp. That way everyone can contribute and some FOPpers, like Mark, do not end up doing all of the work. I would continue these conversations with my co-leader throughout the trip so that we could lead more effectively.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Rowing in high school, and now in college, has taught me a lot about leadership and motivation in tough physical situations. Last year as a senior on my high school team I encouraged the younger rowers through tiring workouts and became adept at keeping up my enthusiasm and energy even when I was also exhausted. These skills will translate well to FOP, since a zealous leader can make a huge difference in transforming a tired and disheartened group into a determined and motivated one. Rowing has also taught me persistence, an attitude which is necessary on FOP. I am always ready for more, whether that means another mile uphill or cooking dinner rather than relaxing once we’ve made camp. This willingness to push my limits is important especially as a leader, where you are looked up to and also expected to complete more tasks. 
	Another of my strengths would be interacting with the freshmen and creating a positive environment. Entering Harvard I was definitely a bit shy and not very self-assured, and FOP helped me to overcome this. As a result, I definitely understand what a lot of the freshman are going through and am eager to help them with this transition process. My FOP leaders were especially good at this, and I learned a lot about how to build an accepting and strong group just through watching them work. I truly enjoy mentoring students and watching them grow, and leading FOP is the perfect opportunity for this.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My greatest challenge in leading a FOP trip would be endeavoring to always be at my best. After a long day of hiking it’s easy to get tired and snippy or lazy, but these are the times when it is possibly the most important on FOP to be working together and establishing a positive group dynamic. It’s not easy to be constantly thinking of others and trying to make the trip as emotionally comfortable as possible for the rest of the group. However, I think this effort on the part of the leaders is what made my trip, and the other trips, so wonderful and what encourages so many freshmen to go on FOP and so many FOPpers to apply to be leaders.
Another challenge would be getting used to being, along with me co-leader, the center of authority. On campus there’s always someone else to defer to or to help you make tough decisions. On a FOP trip, however, it is crucial that the leaders be prepared to make these decisions and make good decisions for the safety of the group. Though I would rise to this challenge, it is nonetheless a lot of pressure. Since I can be a bit strong-headed, the decision to re-route especially would be a difficult one for me to make. However, since FOP is about forming a community, not hiking as much as possible, I would definitely make these adjustments when necessary.
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I’m one of those people who makes a lot of lists, so decision making is definitely a very organized process for me. One of the most laborious decisions I made recently was which classes to take freshman fall (pretty exciting and original, I know). The first step I took was attending the fairs for different concentrations. Since I know I’m interested in engineering, I brought home a couple of the lists of mandatory classes for different types of engineering. After perusing these lists, I asked questions to the teachers and students present from these departments about which classes (and how many classes) they recommended taking freshman year.
My next main step was to consider out-of-concentration interests. I had to take Expos, so that was one class already set in stone. I also wanted to take a freshman seminar, since this seemed like a unique opportunity to meet and bond with classmates and a teacher in a smaller class environment. I took Chinese in high school and was interested in continuing in college. Finally, I felt obligated to look into Gen Ed courses to fulfill these requirements. I ultimately chose three classes before shopping week, then had three more which I shopped to determine which I would take. After consulting my academic advisor, I chose this final class. In retrospect, I wish I had considered more popular courses so I could get used to the large class environment. All in all, however, I am very content with my decisions.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My main concerns are with the interactions between the FOPpers, though it isn’t ideal that we spent half an hour going down the wrong trail. Has Peter been consulting me about trail choices? Have we been reviewing the maps? It is hard to tell whether this was a thoughtless and easily rectified one time mistake or an example of a deeper problem in leader relations. If there is a leadership issue, it would definitely be a priority to fix it. I would talk to Peter and make sure we have a clear plan for the next day and that we are always consulting the maps and each other when we come to unclear forks in the path.
	Another point of concern is Renee. Rather than opening up, as one should be doing during the course of a FOP trip, she seems to be pulling further into her shell. Possibly this is because she can’t relate to Lizzie and Matilda’s experiences, or feels that her additions wouldn’t be interesting. Whatever the case I would make an effort to include her in the dinner conversation and perhaps play another getting-to-know you type game after dinner so that she has a chance to share some of her childhood experiences and realize that she, too, has insight to offer. The next day on the hike I would make an effort to talk with her, especially if I had openings to engage her in more conversation with some of the other FOPpers. Kelly seems to be similarly quiet, so maybe together they would find more opportunities to talk about themselves without having to aggressively work their way into conversations. Jack, too, could use some encouragement to join in. It can be hard to put yourself out there, so as a leader I would do my best to incorporate these people and make them feel comfortable with me and with each other.
Another concern would be the two groups of questionable interactions: Suzy and Mark and Phillip and Daniel. The Suzy and Mark interaction definitely seems positive, and if the two are having a good time and becoming friends that’s great. However, it’s necessary to keep an eye on the situation just to ensure that there’s no “hop on FOP.” If they are integrated in the group and not their own separate clique there doesn’t seem to be any other issue with this duo. I would, however, encourage everyone to carry their share of group gear and certainly their own personal gear. Though it is nice of Mark to do this, FOP is a team experience and it’s unfair to have Mark do so much work even if he’s willing. As far as the other relationship goes, Peter should encourage Phillip to talk with other people and not just with himself. Daniel may have more luck conversing with the rest of the group and meeting new people. Also, it would be best not to encourage talking about getting “trashed” while on the trip.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[January 2012- Abel Tasman National Park Trail. 3 day hike with two other friends, which consisted of walking around 15km on a flattish coastal trail per day. In charge of first aid kit, carrying our tent and booking the two campsites that we would stay at along the way.

March 2012- 130km cycling day trip from Christchurch to Hanmer Springs. I planned the exact route that we would take and tried to pick the least busy roads that still lead us on a fairly direct route. I also organized the rotation system for driving the ‘support’ van for different stages.

July 2011- 3-day ski trip with friends, Porter Heights. Stayed in a lodge on the ski field over two nights where I was in charge of making the porridge for breakfast every morning and participated in a rotation system for chores over those days which included cleaning the bathrooms and vacuuming etc.

I have grown up in a family that loves spending time in the outdoors. We would go jet-boating up remote rivers and camp or stay in huts overnight. I also did a lot of mountain biking, swimming in the ocean and skiing growing up, and I feel really comfortable in the outdoors.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think that I would bring a great sense of humor, a passion for being in the outdoors, and a genuine interest in getting to know people. I’m a very easy-going, sociable person and I love meeting and just hanging out with people. I have been rowing for the past 6 years of my life, which has taught me a lot about teamwork, and involves spending a significant amount of time outdoors. I am also confident in the areas of participation, motivation and communication, and believe that this would be a big strength to make sure everyone has an awesome FOP experience!]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>Despite the fact that I am a keen outdoors adventurer, I think that it's important in this situation to soak up the outdoor experience but to also focus on the group as a whole, and make sure that everyone is enjoying themselves. It would be really important to keep an eye out for those who are struggling physically or socially. One of the greatest challenges would be to form a strong sense of trust between all of the group members, and for everyone to respect each other from the start. This would create a really strong group dynamic and it would be easier to identify and deal with potential issues in a positive constructive way.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>Over summer break this year, I was in a small town in Spain and my trip around Europe was coming to an end. On one of the last nights, the apartment we were staying at had overbooked us and we had to try and find accommodation for the night. There was a windsurfing competition on, and either everywhere was booked out or the few places available were ridiculously expensive for us travelers on a budget!
We had a small tent and decided that pitching it on the beach as the sun went down would be our best bet. As 3 girls traveling together, safety was a major factor but I felt like we would be fine as we were pretty well acquainted with the town by that stage and felt comfortable.
The weather was another factor to consider but the temperature didn't drop too much at night comparatively to the hot day-time temperatures, and there was no rain or big winds forecasted.
Money was another issue. Although I could have gotten my parents to wire through money, it takes a couple of days for the money to go through so there was not much point as our trip was nearing an end. Another factor was considering whether we could get in trouble with the law as freedom camping on the beach is illegal. In hindsight, it probably would have been better to think ahead and have budgeted more money in the first place for circumstances like this, and to have properly considered the consequences of being caught camping on the beach.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Renee seems socially withdrawn despite being friendly and chatty at beginning. I would try to reintegrate Renee back into the group and facilitate more discussion between everyone. This could be achieved by trying to steer Lizzie and Matilda's conversations away from upbringing and maybe focus a little more on things that they all may have in common such as classes they are thinking of taking or extra-curriculars that they wish to pursue at Harvard. It may be a good idea to introduce small activities and facilitate conversations that involve the whole group, with the aim of making it a little less ‘cliquey.’

Kelly with the shivering could be at risk of hypothermia and with a strenuous hike next day, its important that she recovers overnight. I would check that she has warm, dry clothes. It would probably be a good idea to get her into a sleeping bag and make sure that when she goes to sleep there is insulation around her sleeping bag to maximize heat. There is most likely surplus food for instances like this so I would make sure that she eats a sugary snack and would make her a hot drink to really try and warm her up. I would also encourage her not to give away her sweet treats to other FOPers! I would check up on her in the morning and make sure that she is feeling warm, energized and ready for the day’s hike.

Although it’s great that Mark is an eager helper, he seems to be doing a lot of the work. I would ask others to help out with duties in a humorous way. Disperse the group gear more equally, offer to take more of the gear myself along with my co-leader, Peter, and maybe challenge some of the more athletic members of the group such as Phillip, to carry a more of the group gear.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think my greatest strengths in leading a group of first year students would involve the way I interact with other people.  I am capable of becoming very close friends with many types of people.  I think this would be a helpful attribute to have on a FOP trip, where the objective is to have a safe and fun trip that leaves a random group of incoming freshmen with lasting friendships.  

Another of my strengths would be my familiarity with serving as mentor for younger students.  As a math tutor, viola teacher, and older sister, I am often a part of the lives of younger people in an advisory capacity, and I have had the opportunity to share what I’ve learned from my experiences in high school and music with them.  Because of this, it would be easy for me to share my experiences about Harvard with a group of first-year students.  

However, I think my greatest strength would be my ability to create a positive, fun environment for others even when there are challenges to be faced.  As viola section leader of my high school’s orchestra, it was my responsibility to socially unite a group of 10-15 violists and make playing in the orchestra fun, despite the work that had to be done to prepare the music.  I would be able to use this skill on a FOP trip to ensure that FOPpers have a good time despite the challenges inherent in hiking in the backcountry.  
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>One of my greatest challenges in leading a FOP trip would be that I am a naturally introverted person.  It is not always my first instinct to be incredibly outgoing or talkative, which would likely be a helpful attribute to have on a FOP trip when, at first, FOPpers may be reluctant to make conversation.  This also means that sometimes I may appear upset or mad when, really, I am just thinking or tired.  
	
Another of my challenges would be that I am not particularly athletic.  I like to run in my free time, but I do not currently play any competitive sports, which likely means that I am less physically able to handle backpacking over extremely challenging terrain than other people.  
	
However, I think my greatest challenge in leading a FOP trip would be that, like many Harvard students, I am a perfectionist.  I would spend a lot of energy trying to make sure that every aspect of the trip occurs exactly according to plan, which is a somewhat less-than-realistic goal in the wilderness.  I would be able to adjust to unpredicted situations and change plans if necessary, but it would always bother me at least a little that things did not happen as expected.  
</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[At the beginning of my freshman year of high school, I participated in many extracurricular activities, but playing basketball and viola were by far the most important to me. I was planning on trying out for the junior varsity basketball team and auditioning for the Maryland Junior All-State Orchestra. I soon discovered that both events were on the same day at the same time.  My dilemma was obvious—which would I choose?

At first, I tried hard to think of a way to attend both events.   I thought that if I changed my audition time, I could attend at least part of basketball tryouts, shower, change, and then drive an hour to the audition. That is, I thought that until I realized that any audition that took place after a basketball tryout would likely be a very poor one.  Then, I contacted the basketball coach to ask about the possibility of making the team without attending the first tryout--slim to none.  After that, I resigned myself to making the choice.  I reasoned that I had already been preparing for the audition for several weeks and that I would be happier to earn a place in the orchestra than to make it onto the basketball team, so I went to the audition.  

Sometimes I wish I had considered the benefit of having regular exercise in my schedule when I was making my decision, but I still love to play viola, so I am happy with my choice.

		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern would be that Kelly is often shivering during breaks.  As a leader, my first responsibility is to make sure that my FOPpers are safe and comfortable.  The issues I noticed that significantly affected the safety of FOPpers were that Kelly was shivering, that a thunderstorm passed through, and that dangerous caves are located near camp.  Since the thunderstorm has passed and the FOPpers have already been warned about the caves, those issues are not as concerning to me.   However, Kelly’s shivering continues to be a problem.  In extreme cases, shivering can be a sign of hypothermia, which is a direct safety concern.  At the very least, Kelly must be uncomfortable, even if she insists she just needs to keep hiking.  

In order to make sure Kelly is comfortable and warm, I would encourage her to put on more layers of clothing, if she is not already wearing all of them.  If she is, I would offer her some of mine if I wasn’t using them.  Throughout the rest of the trip, I would continue to discretely pay careful attention to Kelly to make sure that she warms up.  

My second concern would be that Renee has stopped interacting with the other FOPpers after Matilda and Lizzie began talking about their childhoods.  Another of my responsibilities as a FOP leader is to make sure that all of my FOPpers are having a good time.  Since Renee has been talking less and less and hiking directly behind me, I am concerned that she is not enjoying her trip as much as she could be.  

Since Kelly and Jack are also fairly quiet, I would try to facilitate interaction between them and Renee.  Also, since Renee had been chatting with Lizzie and Matilda before they started talking about their family vacations, I would try to initiate conversations about other topics that are interesting and common to all three girls.  Many of the FOPpers like Mark, so I would try to include him in the conversations as well.  

My third concern would be the interaction between Phillip and Daniel.  As a FOP leader, I would try to help each of my FOPpers adjust to college as easily as possible.  Since Daniel seems unusually concerned with receiving Phillip’s attention and “getting trashed” with him once they return to campus, I am worried that he may not be prepared have the most fulfilling social experience possible in college.  

I would try to tell Daniel about what I have found to be true during my freshman year—that while many students find drinking to be an enjoyable part of their lives, there are also many other ways to have fun on campus.  I would also encourage both Daniel and Phillip to interact with all types of people, not just ones that are perceived to be cool or more mature, because I have found that my own interactions with many types of students are some of the most valuable aspects of a Harvard education.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[Day Hikes.  I have gone on many day-hikes in the northeast with my family.  I did not plan the trips but am comfortable and enjoy being outdoors and know basic outdoor safety.

Skiing.  I have been skiing all my life.  Skiing has helped me look out for my own safety and that of my friends in riskier, outdoors, situations.

FOP Backpacking C (August 2013).  This trip was my first backpacking experience and I am glad I took the plunge and challenged myself with a C level trip.   I was able to keep up with my group  hiking-wise and was an active part of the trip both in terms of creating a positive dynamic and in the actual camp chores.  I struggled with the knots, but adapted quickly to the other aspects of backpacking.  I found being in the ‘backcountry’ to be a really special change of pace from every-day life and I am excited to have the opportunity to spend more time in the backcountry and to learn the skills I need to do this.  I enjoyed the physical challenge of hiking as well, and look forward to the challenges of actually leading a trip.
]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Tutor (2011-2013).  I tutored math, chemistry, and other academic subjects to high school students.  To tutor successfully you have to be patient as well as receptive.  Many students don’t say when they are struggling or when they don’t get it and I have become very able to pick up on this and to transition to different teaching approaches.  I also am able to relate with my peers from a position of authority. 

Girls State House Minority Leader (July 2012).  Girls State is a mock government program with 300 girls from all over the state.  I ran for, and was elected, House Minority Leader.  I was responsible for getting the opinions of about 100 girls and making voting decisions for the party.  I had to make fair-decisions for a large group and also operate within the existing Girls State Rules which were sometimes frustrating.  

Peer Mentor (2012-2013). Senior year of High School I volunteered for the peer-
mentorship program ‘Stand by Me’ which is geared toward freshman having a difficult first-year.  I was in the position of helping my mentee transition into the social and academic life of my high school.  This experience helped me develop my reaching out skills and my patience.

		<Q7.2>Fop leaders have the important role of creating a fun and open environment.  However it is also important to keep sight of what it means to be a leader and not a fopper.  I have done a lot of tutoring as well as peer-mentoring and am very comfortable being friendly but still keeping an appropriate relationship.  This will help me lead the group; I can be relatable and a friend but still a leader and a source of advice. Tutoring has also taught me to be patient and to recognize when lessons are not sinking in.  FOP is a major learning experience for many and these teaching skills will help me help those in my group learn outdoor-skills.   </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[A challenge for me will be confidence in my outdoor skills. I have little backpacking experience so will have to really practice these skills in order to not only be able to teach the skills but also to be able to manage the trip. Another challenge for me will be reigning in my sass.  My sense of humor can get very sassy and I know that is often very damaging the dynamic of a group because it can be (inadvertently) undermining.  I will have to be careful to keep my humor constructive and positive so the trip remain a safe-space and so that I am leading by example-  to not encourage the other foppers to undermine each other.  ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[	The morning after returning from my FOP trip I treated myself and slept in.  I arrived at the dorm around 12 to find two of the three rooms already moved into.  I was surprised and unsettled by this even though I understood that my suitemates wanted to make the most of their parents manpower to move their things in.  My difficult decision was whether to confront my suitemates and ask for a redrawing of rooms or to accept the last room left.   Furthermore, I had to start moving in myself and did not have much time to make-up my mind.  My main concern was not so much the quality of the room as the impact each option would have on my then fledgling relationship with the girls I would be living all year.  I was worried that making us change the rooms would antagonize Rachel and Lauren and start us off on the wrong foot.  However I soon realized that it was important for me to not feel that I had gotten short-changed, this feeling could build and play into other problems later.  So, I sat down with them and explained how I felt and suggested we draw papers out of a hat.   I explained this calmly and made sure to be nice about it so they understood I was not angry at them.  They agreed and we redrew. I feel good about this decision because although it was challenging in the short-term, it paid off in the long-term as it let me start fresh and not wonder ‘what-if’ throughout the year.  ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[No FOP trip is perfect, it is important for leaders to be able to tell which issues are not ideal but not a major threat to the foppers and which need to be confronted.  Physical safety is the most pressing concern, issues of safety can not only disrupt the trip but ideally no one gets seriously, or even kind of seriously hurt on FOP.  Individual and group experience are also important but these problems are harder confront.  Both of these types of issues present themselves on this trip.  
	My first concern is Gage Caves.   Gage Caves are not only close and dangerous, but also present an opportunity for a fopper to try and impress the others.  Given the dynamic both between Daniel and Phillip as well as that between Phillip and Peter this could very well be a motivation to go.  Peter already told the group not to go, I would be sure to repeat this- perhaps with some more vivid details of what could happen.  This would hopefully create group pressure against going, changing going to the caves from impressive to frowned upon.  Finally, I would plan for me and Peter to be extra vigilant when going to bed, and to make an effort to be in a tent with Daniel or Phillip.
	My next concern is Kelly’s shivering.  First, this is a physical concern, being too cold is dangerous.  Furthermore, it is a big negative for Kelly and could really hurt her FOP experience .  She is already quiet, being cold probably plays into this by wearing her down more.   She might not have more layers, I would ask in private- not in front of the group in case she feels intimidated- and if she didn’t I would find one to lend her.  If addressing the issue directly failed, the next thing I would try is taking more layering breaks and taking off a fleece near Kelly and offering it to her. 
	My third concern is the dynamic between Lizzie and Matilda.  I appreciate that they click, but FOP is also about getting to know people different from you.  They are not only missing out themselves but are intimidating at least Renee and possibly the other Fopper’s, skewing the group dynamic.  I would talk this over with Peter to get his perspective.  I would want to address this with conversational and hiking activities.  The first step would be for the two girl to spend some time not walking with each other have people line up by birthday, by last name etc…. I would also set some conversation goals that fall outside of socio-economic background to open them up to other conversation.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[When leading a FOP group it is important to build friendship and camaraderie. Since I’m very empathetic and a good listener, I will be able to keep track of how FOPers are feeling and maximize their enjoyment of the experience. I am also very good at anticipating possible problems before they arise. I’m the kind of person who reminds everyone to go to the bathroom before starting a long drive and double-knots his shoe laces. I also have teaching experience both inside and outside of formal teaching settings. Even when I’m just in a study group I’m often the person who will present lessons and check to make sure that everyone is following what we are learning. I am very tolerant of mistakes and work with people closely to help them improve. Not only will I be good at teaching outdoor skills, but I will truly enjoy teaching them. My greatest strength though would have to be my enthusiasm and willingness to participate. My friends have often told me that my enthusiasm is contagious, and that they feel at ease with me around. I know that as a FOPer I really bought into the FOP experience, and that helped the rest of my group to buy in too. I will do the same as a FOP leader.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My greatest challenge would be not staying on FOP time. As a FOPer I really enjoyed the opportunity to give up my phone and my watch for a week. The experience was very peaceful and I felt that letting all that go put my mind in a relaxed state. My sleep schedule even adjusted to a natural rhythm. Having a watch will make the experience more challenging, since my watch is what normally runs my life in the front country. I will have no issues being the one responsible for everyone, but just having a watch is something that may prevent me from getting into a relaxed FOP mindset, but I’m sure that this will not transmit to the FOPers.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I served on the disciplinary committee at my high school, which meant that I frequently had to make challenging decisions when students broke the rules. Normally the decisions were based on past precedents, but the most difficult decision I ever had to make was when one of my very dear friends came before the committee for cheating on his homework. Unlike my previous decisions on the committee this one could affect our friendship. I thought about excusing myself from the committee, but I realized then that my friend would be completely unrepresented. I was very surprised to see him there because I knew him as a hardworking and considerate person. I had to try and separate my emotions about him as a person and a friend from my need to issue a decision. The choice was whether to give him a warning or put him on disciplinary probation, which gets reported to colleges. I knew that he was a good guy who would definitely be able to correct his behavior, but I also wanted to make sure he would never cheat again. This thought process lead me to the decision of disciplinary probation. I felt that I could justify this decision to him as me trying to be a good friend. I only wish that I could’ve gotten to talk to him in private to find out what had lead him to cheat and solve the problem from its cause.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The largest issue with this situation is my communication with Peter. It seems that in many cases I blame Peter for something which should be both of our responsibilities. It’s never just Peter’s fault that the group took the wrong path, we both have to be paying attention to make sure we are going the right way. It sounds like Peter also doesn’t check in with me when making decisions. Instead, he just declares what is going to happen next, like he did when we first arrived at camp tonight. I don’t necessarily think its a good idea to have a competition to set up the tarps because they should be set up carefully instead of hastily, but Peter never checked to see what I thought about it. The first thing I need to do before starting out tomorrow is talk to Peter and make sure that we are more on the same page and can share responsibility.

Another issue with this situation is that FOPers have different socioeconomic origins. Of course, this is an unavoidable fact in any group of people, but Renee’s discomfort with Lizzie and Matilda’s conversation about their vacations is cause for concern. When you are just starting out at a new school and feel like you are lacking an experience that other people have it can be very disconcerting. This is especially true when you are in a small FOP group and might assume that people’s behavior there represents a majority of the school’s population. Tomorrow I might try to ask questions or direct conversation towards topics that are not necessarily about socioeconomic status, like what people are hoping for the future as opposed to what they have done in the past. I may also run an activity where people voice their concerns about college to give Renee an opportunity to speak up about her discomfort.

Lastly, all FOPers should take care of themselves first, and then take care of the group. Mark has generously volunteered to take on a very large weight in his pack, but it is not appropriate. Not only does he have a large amount of group gear, but he is also carrying items for other FOPers. I believe that part of the FOP experience is learning to care for yourself and proving to yourself that you can. Therefore, everyone should carry their own items before helping others. FOP trips are also supposed to build a community, and part of this comes from sharing equal loads of group gear. Tomorrow I will make a general announcement that everyone should only carry their own items. I’ll do this without assigning any blame or naming names. I will also make sure that equal piles of group equipment get made so that everyone is carrying approximately the same amount of group gear.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2>I think I would bring a lot of experience to the group. Not only do I have a good deal of training and experience with the outdoors and the hard skills required to keep a group safe in the wilderness, but I also have a lot of practice in group dynamics and fostering community. As a camp counselor, I spend each week bringing a group of strangers together and helping them to build trust and friendships that will last well beyond the one week we have together. I think I could help build the same sort of bonds between the participants on a FOP trip. The skills I have that would help gives these kids the best experience possible are a willingness to listen, a fun-loving attitude, and a respect for the dangers of the outdoors. </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[As a leader, I think my biggest shortcoming is my tendency to lose sight of the big picture. Sometimes I will get so caught up in the task at hand, whether it’s hitting a certain peak or making dinner, that I put too much focus on completing it and not enough on the other parts of the trip that will make it memorable and important for the participant. For example, on my training trip for HOC, I was co-leading the last part of the first day’s hike, and my co-leaders and I got so caught up in finding our campsite in the dark that we were neglecting our participant’s hydration and warmth. We didn’t even realize it had happened until our leaders pointed it out that night. That has been something I work hard at being aware of.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[During the college selection process, the hardest decision I had to make wasn’t selecting a school, but rather deciding to only apply to schools out of state. Harvard was my stretch school, and besides that I only applied to schools on the coast. My thought process was that there are very few times when you can do something radical, like move across the country, and get away with it. I also knew how much I loved Minnesota, but if I didn’t try anything new, I would always wonder what else was out there for me. I factored in almost everything when deciding this (distance from friends/family, etc.) and I have to say, I’m very glad I decided to put myself out there and take that chance.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[One of my concerns is with Kelly. Although she says she claims to be fine during the actual hiking, the reoccurrence of her shivering has me concerned. Shivering can just be from being too cold, but with her decreased appetite as well, there could be a possibility of sickness that has caused her to be feverish. For now, I’d make sure she’s plenty warm, try to get her to eat more, and keep an eye on her for the next day or so.

	Another concern is about my co-leader Peter and Phillip. Although he may be a little annoying to Peter, it is unacceptable for him to be rolling his eyes at Phillip’s stories. Clearly Phillip looks up to Peter, so for him to demonstrate any kind of distain towards Phillip is not ok. Not only would it really hurt Phillip if he saw it, but if the other participants were to pick up on it, they might start to treat him the same way. As leaders it is our job to build up each of the participants, not tear them down. I would talk to Peter about being more positive toward Phillip, and also create a plan to get Phillip more involved with the other members of the group.

	My final concern is with Renee. She seems to have been made uncomfortable by the other girls talking about their home life, and it’s gotten in the way of her enjoyment of the trip. There are several ways to go about this. One would be to try to change the subject and get her back into the conversation. This would be an easy way to keep the trip light and fun. But to make the trip more meaningful, I think it would be better to try and start an open and honest conversation about where each participant comes from. I wouldn’t force the issue, but I think if we could have a respectful and honest conversation about this, we’d reach a new level of togetherness and the trip could be truly memorable for everyone.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[One of my strengths as a FOP leader would be my ability to connect with the FOPpers and make them feel comfortable through talking to them and listening. An important part of FOP is introducing freshmen to a supportive community, but initially they may feel awkward around strangers (I certainly did). From personal experience I have learned getting a conversation going is one of the best ways to overcome awkwardness. From having three younger siblings, tutoring kids of all ages, and befriending people four years older than me to four years younger at track, I find myself very comfortable talking with others regardless of differences in age or tastes. On my own FOP trip I spent the first morning of hiking telling the girl in front of me all my embarrassing family stories. By lunch she was telling me stories and we had the whole group laughing. My openness to conversation helps with general communication as well, showing the FOPpers and my co-leader that I am easy to talk to about anything they want to tell me. 
Additionally, for many FOPpers backpacking is a new experience, and although it is amazing it’s exhausting as well. When spirits get low it’s easy for a whole group to be brought down, which dampens the fun of FOP. In these situations I often find myself determined to cheer others up, becoming that annoyingly optimistic person who is infectiously happy until others catch on as well.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I would struggle as a leader when facing situations requiring discipline. Even when in a leadership position I don’t see myself as above others, so I don’t always feel confident enough to tell them what to do. As a captain of my track team I often struggled with this. I was friends with all the girls on the team, so when it was time to get down to business I found it difficult for me to reprimand my friends’ unruly behaviors. In FOP your FOP group becomes like a second family, and I’m not much older than the first-year students, making it a similar situation where I would struggle with controlling the group. 
I also struggle with indecision when faced with uncertain outcomes. I dislike making decisions without having enough information or time to make a good decision. As a leader of first-years on FOP many important decisions many need to be made due to unexpected circumstances. In these situations I can find it difficult to make a decision for fear of making a bad one. On my FOP trip we faced the possibility of a campsite down the trail not having any water, and not knowing if we would be able to refill our water bottles or have water to cook. Though the decision did not fall on me, just thinking about it made me nervous because there was so much uncertainty. As a leader on FOP this would definitely be one of the greatest challenges to me.
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>Last year I faced a tough decision when someone I knew from school texted me telling me saying he was considering suicide. At first I was too shocked to think, and then I felt pure panic, having no idea how to handle this. I then realized I was focusing on myself and how upset I was feeling rather than what he was going through and the gravity of his comment. I kept talking to him, trying to calm him down, at which point he asked me not to tell anyone. I knew in these situations it was important to let adults know, but I was also afraid of upsetting him further. I had to decide between telling someone right away and keeping it to myself. In making a decision I had to weigh the important help he could receive with the risk losing his trust, thus losing my ability to be there for him if it ever happened again and possibly stopping him. I concluded that telling others would allow more people to be aware of his situation, giving him a support network to rely on even if I lost his trust. 
I wish I were better able to consider how he was feeling and help him talk through it more. I stand by my decision to involve others in the situation because it certainly was not something to joke about and they needed to know, but I still wish I was able to help calm him down more.
</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My three immediate concerns would be group cohesion, FOPper health, and the campsite’s preparation.
Group cohesion seems to be faltering slightly and some of the FOPpers seem more distant than others. Renee, Kelly, and Jack are all being very quiet while Mark and Suzy, Lizzie and Matilda, and Daniel and Philip seem to have limited communications with others in the group. FOP is about creating a great network of people to trust and depend on for the transition to Harvard, but if FOPpers are separating themselves that network cannot be formed. Although having a great friend is nice, a network of friends for the start of freshman year and beyond is really important. Also I want all the FOPpers to feel like they can depend on any other person in the group, and with small groups forming and other FOPpers quietly separating themselves, the FOPpers may not experience this trust. Ending FOP feeling alone or ignored can ruin the entire FOP experience, regardless of how amazing it was before, making the lack of group cohesion a real concern. To address this I would make sure my co-leader and I lead an awesome fuzzy cheesecake session to hopefully bring the group back together. This can be supplemented by mixing up the hiking order on the next day to make sure the groups don’t reform and leave people out. 
As for FOPper health, Kelly’s shivering and small appetite, and Mark carrying excess weight are the main health concerns for the group. Kelly could be sick with a serious underlying problem, and Mark could be injured or overly fatigued but is toughing it out for the group. This is concerning because I want all FOPpers to have a great experience, and illness or injury are not beneficial to that goal. I would address this concern through a quick health check. My co-leader and I could do end-of-FOP health check-ins, similar to the pre-FOP health check-ins to prevent anyone from being singled out, which could be uncomfortable. This would allow us to hopefully address Kelly’s possible health situation and gauge how Mark is actually doing, as well as giving other FOPpers an opportunity to let us know about problems we may not be aware of. It also opens up another channel of communication in case they have any concerns unrelated to health they want to discuss.  
My third concern is the campsite’s preparation. Having a competition for setting up camp fastest could result in a poorly made campsite, and following the extended day of hiking and poor weather a night of bad weather under a poorly set up tarp could ruin the final night of FOP.  Unfortunately this could carry over and leave the FOPpers in a bad mood for the last day of FOP. To address this I would change the challenge to see who could set up the camp better, rather than faster. This will hopefully prevent any cursory mistakes in preparation while still allowing a fun, competitive atmosphere.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[In the past year, I have grown enormously as a leader. This semester, I became a PAF and have 9 PAFees that I meet with regularly and mentor. I honed my leadership skills this summer coaching kids ages 4-18 at UC Berkeley and 4th and 1. Working with such diverse groups of kids helped me develop my problem solving and communication skills with fellow staff and coaches. Though I have worked at summer camps for most of high school, I had never coached older kids before, so working at football camp with kids close to my age helped me become more confident in my ability to be an effective leader despite a very small age difference. I still keep in touch with my football mentees (both current high school seniors) and their families, and I am currently helping them navigate the college admissions and financial aid application process. Last week, I was elected comp director for The Crimson sports board, so starting next semester I will be overseeing the comp process for new editors (mostly freshmen). Outside of direct group leadership experience, my team (women’s rugby) went from club to varsity this year. Our new coaches have pushed us mentally and physically like never before, and the experience has brought our team a lot closer. I came out of my first semester as a varsity athlete feeling more mature and confident in my ability to be a productive and positive contributor to my team culture on and off the field, and I have discovered that I am capable of overcoming much more adversity than I thought possible.]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2>	When I applied for FOP the first time around, I had spent a semester at Harvard and thought I knew it all. Since then, my love for the outdoors has not changed, but my strength as a leader, maturity, and experience has. Over the past semester, I have proven myself as a mentor through PAFing, and I have developed close relationships with most of my PAFees. I am warm and approachable but still professional and understand the responsibilities that come along with being a role model. I have always been the person friends came to for advice or support, and I love and thrive in that role.
	I am very level-headed and cool under pressure, especially in physically demanding situations. Working at sports camp this summer, I patched up more injuries than I could count and am very confident in my ability to handle stressful situations rationally and with poise. Though I take things seriously, I generally have a laid back and positive attitude.
	As an athlete, I have learned to work with so many different kinds of people with different leadership styles. I take pride in getting along well with everyone, but I tackle potential conflict head on with a clear and effective communication style. No matter with whom I was co-leading, I would be an asset to a cohesive and united team.

		<Q7.3><![CDATA[	FOP was an incredible growth experience for me, but it wasn’t always fun. Sometimes we were cold, exhausted, and hungry. Sometimes we were behind schedule and had to take a short lunch or hike as the sun went down to make it to camp. Though I had fun most of the time, the moments where I was struggling were those of greatest personal growth and ultimately the most gratifying when I look back on my experience.
	I believe my greatest challenge in being a new leader will be having enough group awareness to allow the kind of growth I experienced on my trip. As a leader in other areas of life, I have found myself very invested in making sure people are always having fun and enjoying themselves. As a generally upbeat person, I don’t like seeing my friends unhappy. I hope that with the right leadership training, I will be able to keep my group safe and happy but respect everyone’s emotions and accept the fact that backpacking in the wilderness is not, and should not, be fun for everyone in every moment.

		<Q7.4><![CDATA[	I knew the moment I went down that I wouldn’t be getting up for a long time. We were 75 minutes into an 80-minute bloodbath, our first rugby game of the season. One moment I was a starter, a division I varsity athlete. The next, I was being carried off the field with a non-functional knee and a season ending injury. 
	I joined rugby to be a competitive athlete, to contribute on the field, and once that was gone I lost my identity on the team. I struggled to keep fighting against an injury that wasn’t healing and the isolation of sitting on the sideline as my team won an emotional Ivy League Championship.
	When I thought about my life without rugby, it was full of ample free time and no pain, no early mornings with the athletic trainer or freezing cold practices I could not participate in. But it also meant I would lose the family I had never asked for or expected to find. I would lose the women who had taken care of me all season, who made me laugh when all I wanted to do was cry, and who—while I was so focused on my own recovery—had become my best friends. No matter how hard things were, I could not repay my family by walking away.
	The knee might never heal enough to play contact sports again. I might make it back to the pitch and never be able to earn back a starting spot. But come spring I’ll be cheering my family on from the sidelines as we play for the national championship.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	The most pressing concern in this scenario is my communication with my co-leader. Based on the description of Peter’s actions, it seems that we are not on the same page about a number of issues that bother me. In my opinion, the way Peter is treating some of the FOPpers, such as letting Mark help with the cooking and take on more gear, is creating difficult interpersonal dynamics on the trip. The first thing I would do is sit down with Peter after the FOPpers go to sleep. It is of the utmost importance that we don’t disagree in front of the FOPpers because we need to maintain the image of a united front in order to be effective leaders. However, it is a serious concern that Peter is making decisions and announcing them to the group without consulting me. I would talk to Peter about creating competition and potentially dangerous situations on the trip, which is a serious issue when we have FOPpers with a huge range of outdoor experience, as well as how the way he has been treating Mark and Phillip seems an inhibiting factor as the group tries to form meaningful relationships with each other.
	FOP is great because it brings together people with such diverse backgrounds, but on this trip so far, it seems the diversity is not being respected. Those with more flashy upbringings and life experiences are doing most of the talking, while people like Renee, Daniel, Kelly and Jack are not getting to express themselves. I would address this by playing a group game with the FOPpers once we have set up camp. On my trip, we had one night where we all gave five-minute autobiographies, and everyone got to ask questions. People who didn’t feel as comfortable talking while hiking had a forum to express themselves and quieter people really came out of their shell and felt that their life stories were valued. On this trip, it’s clear that we have such a range of personalities and that some people are going to talk more than others. Though I understand that some people will naturally take on more of a leadership role than others, it is important to ensure that everyone has a space in which their voices can be heard and valued.
	Finally, I would check in with Kelly to make sure that everything is okay. Though she may just have a quiet and generous personality, it makes me nervous that she is cold and not eating very much. We still have two more days to hike, including a tough five-mile day tomorrow, and it seems there may be other issues at play here. After consulting with Peter, I would talk to her privately rather than in front of the group to make sure that she has enough layers and is getting enough to eat. Thus far, we have only talked to her in front of the group at breaks, and there may be concerns she doesn’t feel comfortable sharing but that could be addressed to make her safer and happier.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[-Winters of 2005-2009:  Participated in 10+ winter camping trips with the Boy Scouts, each lasting 2 days.  I worked with a group to plan and purchase food before the start of the trip.  On the trips, I worked to set up camp (including building snow caves to sleep in) and often led cooking the food for the group.

-Summers of 2006-2008:  Attended Camp Gorsuch Boy Scout Camp, each time for 7 nights.  I helped set up camp and cooked meals for the group.

-Summer 2007:  I earned my Hiking merit badge for Boy Scouts, which entailed five 10+ mile hikes and one 20+ mile hike.  Locations of these hikes included Kennecott, AK, Yosemite, CA, and Dechusetts River, OR.  For each of these hikes, I planned the route and packed the necessary gear.  Earning the merit badge also required learning about the most common injuries that occur while hiking and how to treat them, as well as demonstrating the principle “leave no trace.”

-June 2008:  8 day canoe trip in the Boundary Waters region of northern Minnesota.  I worked with my parents to plan the route and gather the food/gear for the trip.

-August 2010:  5 day sea kayaking trip with my family in Prince William Sound near Whittier, Alaska.  I learned how to kayak on the trip, helped set up camp every night and assisted with food preparation.

-July of 2011:  Camped in rural Madagascar for 2 weeks while working on a school construction project.  I helped with setting up the camp as well as other duties such as food prep/preparing drinking water.

-Beginning when I was around 4 or 5 and continuing until I was 18, I went hiking or camping at least once a month during the summers in Alaska with either my family or friends.  These excursions consisted of everything from day hiking trips on trails 10 minutes from my house to several-day fishing camping trips while fishing.  I’ve also hiked/camped with my family while travelling all over the world including a 3 week camping safari in Southern Africa, a 2 week camping road trip in Eastern Canada, and a hiking trip in Nepal.

-I've also spent a lot of time in the woods surrounding my home in Alaska, doing activities such as picking berries and chopping firewood.

-August 2012:  Participated in FOP 1 (yeah switch!)]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2>-2008:  I served as a Patrol Leader in my Boy Scout troop for about 6 months.  I helped lead the weekly Boy Scout meeting and taught skills such as knot-tying and first aid to younger scouts.

-September-December 2011:  I worked as a math and chemistry private tutor for a special needs student.

-2011-2012 school-year:  I served as the president of the debate team at my high school, which had a membership of approximately 50 students.  I helped other students with their debate cases and preparation and assisted with running practices for the novice debaters.

-2011-2012 school-year:  I was the president of the National Honor Society at my high school, which entailed coordinating volunteer projects and leading meetings of over 100 students.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[	One of the greatest strengths I could bring to leading a FOP trip is a passion for teaching others.  I really enjoy working with other people, especially in more intimate settings, and helping them learn new knowledge and new skills.  This is clearly a crucial element of leading a FOP trip, as conveying information about skills such as how to set up camp and how to pack a backpack is important for a successful trip.  I’m also very comfortable in wilderness settings, as I’ve spent my whole childhood participating in outdoor activities.  This sense of ease in the wilderness would likely rub off onto any of the first-year students who may feel more out of place in the wilderness, and would allow the trip to function more smoothly overall.
	On a more personal level, I also think I can provide valuable insight into a lot of the challenges of the first year at Harvard.  Adjusting to Harvard was very challenging for me – I had never lived outside of Alaska before, and so the culture shock of living in the urban East Coast coupled with the general struggles of starting college were a lot to bear.  But by working through these challenges on my own and by coming to feel a lot more confident and comfortable with Harvard, I feel that I can help these first-year students feel better prepared for the difficulties they will face in their first year of college.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[	One issue that could potentially impede my ability to lead a group of first-year students on a FOP trip is my tendency to be a bit introverted.  I’m not always an outgoing and social person, and sometimes this means that it takes me a little longer to open up to people and to get to know them well.  This is a challenge that I've had to overcome before, particularly in other settings that involve teaching and leading groups of people.
	Related to this, I am also sometimes insecure and unsure of my decisions when I lead a group of people.  This tendency to second guess the choices I make could interfere with my leadership abilities on a FOP trip to a certain extent, as I feel that straightforward and sure direction is the best way to lead and teach others.  Again, this is an issue that has manifested itself in many forms over the course of my life, and is something that I would definitely need to be conscious of as a FOP leader.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>	One difficult decision I made was my choice to leave Alaska and attend Harvard.  My high school rarely sent students out of state for college, and the few that did tended to stay on the West Coast.  Although I had traveled outside of Alaska extensively, I had never lived elsewhere, and was not sure whether leaving would be a good life decision.  In addition, there was a somewhat of a negative reaction among my peers to the idea that I was considering going to Harvard, as the general perception of East Coast culture is that people are shallow and stuck-up.  Friends warned that going to Harvard would change me and turn me into someone they couldn't relate to.
	One element of my decision was that I didn't feel completely confident in my choice to live in Alaska without having lived elsewhere.  I felt that living somewhere completely different was important, if only to validate my decision to return to Alaska.  I also realized that the decision I made needed to be based on my best interests alone and not on the opinions of others; Harvard offers academic opportunities I could never get in Alaska, and concerns about the anti-East Coast stigma shouldn't be enough to prevent me from taking the chance.  I wish I had more strongly considered the opportunities to meet and learn from such a diverse group of people at Harvard, as this would have given me more confidence in my decision to leave Alaska.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	My first major concern is with Kelly’s physical well-being.  The fact that Kelly gives much of her food away and that she appears cold and fatigued during the breaks suggests that she is not getting enough to eat, which may allude to a larger concern, such as an eating disorder.  To address this issue, I would pull Kelly aside and have a one-on-one conversation with her.  I would probably explain to her that she’s been expending a lot more energy and burning more calories that she normally does, and thus she may need to eat more to compensate.  I realize that eating disorders are a very complicated psychological and emotional issue, and thus I wouldn’t try to address the root cause of Kelly’s problem by myself during the trip.  Instead, I would wait until we are back on campus, where I would seek the help of some sort of eating disorder advising resource (such as ECHO) and try to arrange for Kelly to speak to someone more qualified.
	My next concern is with the behavior of my co-leader Peter, as I think he’s done a number of things recently that are inappropriate.  I would talk with him privately to let him know that I felt some of the decisions he made were not well thought through, and that I wish he would have conferred with me.  Namely, I don’t think that informing the group of the Gage Caves was the right decision, as this is only going to tempt them to go check this area out.  I also don’t feel that turning setting up camp into a competition is particularly conducive to a cohesive group dynamic.  Additionally, I would talk to Peter about some of his interactions, such as his eye roll at Phillip, and would let him know that I don’t think this is an appropriate way to treat the FOPers.  I would frame the conversation as saying that I just want the trip to be as meaningful to everyone as possible, and that he should let me know of any concerns he has on my part.
	My final concern is with the conversation I overheard about Daniel wanting to “get trashed” with Phillip when they are back on campus.  Alcohol and its role in college life are important topics to discuss with the FOPers, and Daniel’s statement suggests that now would be a good time to have this conversation.  I would involve the whole group in this talk about alcohol so as to not single-out Daniel and to ensure that all of them have an opportunity to ask questions.  The points I would try to emphasize in the discussion are that alcohol is a part of college social life for many people, but not for everyone, and that drinking responsibly by eating and staying hydrated is important for those who chose to drink.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I loved my FOP experience - feeling I had accomplished something concrete and real, the beauty of the mountains, and the feeling of being alive and exhausted after a long day- and more than anything else I want everyone to have as amazing a time as I had, so my priority as a leader would be to make sure everyone feels comfortable and ready to start college (like my leaders helped me feel). I enjoy group settings and get along with almost everyone I meet, and as the oldest of four siblings and a team captain I have a lot of experience diffusing tension in groups and getting people to work together and get along. Rowing taught me a lot about working together with all sorts of people (including those you may not like); I spent months with the same thirty girls and the only way to survive was to see the best in everyone and get along and, as team captain, to make sure everyone else did the same. I’m good at navigating group dynamics and like talking to people and listening to their stories (another thing I appreciated in my FOP leaders, who were excellent at getting everyone to share while we were on the trail). I enjoy being the responsible one who knows what’s going on, and love being able to pass on what I know to others. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I guess my biggest challenge when dealing with groups of people is that if there’s one person I take a disliking to, for whatever reason, it’s hard for me to let that impression go. I wouldn’t be rude to anyone ever, but I sometimes try to avoid interactions with people who bother me. I don’t want to be mean to people so if someone is annoying me, I’ll try to avoid him or her until I stop being irritated. This would obviously be a poor quality in a FOP leader, because part of what makes FOP so successful is the way leaders are able to help everyone feel like a part of the group. An important thing I would want to continue to work on if I get to train to be a FOP leader would be my ability to talk to people I don’t like. While I don’t think I’m a mean person or likely to make someone’s FOP trip a negative experience, I know that this personal challenge of mine would be something to work on to make FOP better for both me and my potential group. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I decided to join the women’s crew team at Harvard. I was not recruited but rowed for four years in high school, so my decision had two parts. First, I chose to join the team. I had gotten so much out of rowing in high school; I loved the sport and couldn’t imagine my life without it. I also valued the friendships I had made and the prospect of making friends on the team was a huge draw for me. I was worried about the time commitment of being a varsity athlete at a D1 school, but I figured that I would have to spend time doing something. I already knew that I loved crew and would miss it. I told myself that by Head of the Charles, if I didn’t like it and felt that it took too much time, I would quit. I’ve since decided that I’ll be sticking it out at least until the end of the year, because the girls on the team are a great community and I love spending time with them. I also had to decide whether to start by practicing with the recruited freshman, or with the walk-ons, who didn’t know how to row. I was not as fast as any of the varsity or recruits, so I was nervous about joining them for practices. But learning to row all over again would have been boring, so I decided to practice with the varsity girls. It’s challenging, but that’s better than boring.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[        Renee is uncomfortable with Lizzie and Matilda discussing their (wealthier) upbringings. Starting a new school is scary and if, in the first week, Renee has already felt alienated from some of her peers and feels unable to participate in conversation because of her upbringing, then FOP won’t be a positive experience, and certainly won’t help her feel more comfortable in her new community. I would try to figure out a way at dinner to remind everyone that at Harvard, they’re going to encounter new people who have had different resources and experiences, and to be aware of that. Maybe continue to try to talk to Renee about anything other than where she’s from- ask her to play a trail game with you and Kelly, ask her about the movies she had been trying to talk to Lizzie and Matilda about. Maybe try to steer Lizzie and Matilda back to that as well. Ask Renee how she’s feeling about Harvard. Ask her if she has any concerns. Don’t explicitly point out to Lizzie and Matilda that they’re being insensitive to Renee, you don’t want to embarrass any of the three of them.
	Phillip’s attitude seems to be one of “I’m wiser and more mature than you all.” This could have negative effects on the rest of the group, and if Peter is rolling his eyes at me, it’s definitely not good. Honestly Phillip is probably a concern for me mostly because I read this description and find him to be annoying. I would want to figure out a way to make sure my negative feelings toward him don’t affect anything I do, and I want to make sure that if anyone else shares my negative reaction, it’s not affecting their enjoyment of the trip. I definitely don’t want any of the FOPpers to pick up on Peter’s eye rolling, and I want to make sure none of them are insulted by Phillip’s “I’m more mature than you are” attitude. I would pay attention to his interactions with other FOPpers and make sure everyone plays nice.
	Kelly is shivering and giving away her food, which seem like possible anorexia flags.  Not sure it’s my place to try and “fix” this here and now, but I need to to make sure she makes it through the trip. Watch to make sure she’s eating enough food to make it through the hiking. It’s one thing to not eat dessert treats, but if she starts not eating food, I need to try and encourage everyone on the trip to eat more- in fact, if dinner is cooking right now, before dinner I should warn everyone how far we’re hiking the next day and encourage them to eat up. If she’s shivering, encourage everyone to check how they’re feeling and add a layer if they’re cold.

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[•	Fall 2010: I was a leader for the 7th grade outdoor bonding trip at my school. I was in charge of a cabin of girls, oversaw the 7th graders participate in team building activities, and also lead a full day hike called "Trek" in which the 7th graders had to navigate through the woods themselves and find flags hidden in it. 
•	2009-2011: Taught many, many children swim lessons. Most of the children were just learning how to swim and were terrified of going underwater. 
•	Summer 2012: Camp counselor at a summer camp, leading 10 girls each week through activities, both outdoors (canoeing/archery/caving/swimming etc.) and bonding activities such as "evening embers" where we ask a serious question every night and everyone discusses their answers. Also worked one-on-one with campers with severe disabilities.
•	Summer 2013: Behavioral specialist at the same summer camp. I was in charge of all of the special needs children at the camp, and the counselors would call me when they had a problem. I was also in charge of dealing with any behavioral problems such as fights or extreme homesickness, and speaking with children who reported having an issue such as abuse at home. 
•	Fall 2012-present - Peer tutor for Ec 10
•	Fall 2012-present: I am a TF for the CrimsonEMS class, which teaches people how to be EMTs. I helped teach the people in the class the skills they need to be a successful EMT.

		<Q6.3>I worked for a second summer at a sleep-away camp in Missouri, as a member of support staff. I had a leadership role, and while the previous summer I went to others when I needed help, last summer I was the person people went to when they needed help. I think that FOP is most similar to our overnight campouts that the campers participated in each week, sleeping under the stars and cooking food over a fire. Part of my job was to make sure all of the special needs campers were comfortable during these campouts. There are three units at my camp, and each unit went on an overnight a different day of the week. This meant that I ended up going on three campouts a week to properly supervise everyone. Furthermore, all of the cabins camped out at different locations, so I often hiked between locations in the middle of the night to go help out different campers and counselors. For many campers, especially special needs campers, sleeping outside with no tent is an overwhelming and scary experience, and my goal each week was to have all of them be comfortable enough to do it. Overnights are also stressful for counselors, who need to cook everyone's food over the fire, which they must build themselves, and keep everyone safe. Thus, three days a week I would camp outside, walking between many different campsites, helping build fires, cooking food, calming children down, and trying and make the experience as enjoyable and being in the outdoors should be.</Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[My greatest strength is that I have two summers of experience being outdoors, leading children and counselors. I have led countless overnight trips and team building activities, seen children embrace the wilderness and the fact that they have no other obligations for a week, and I have seen children become overwhelmed by the experience and act out. My second year at the camp, I was the person that the Unit Directors (the position who counselors reported too) called when there was a problem in their unit that they were not equipped to deal with. I would often show up to where they called me with no idea what issue I was going to encounter, and I was expected to solve it. I have dealt with a child who locked himself in a bathroom stall for hours, a child who was actively trying to run away from camp, screamers, punchers, and children who spoke about being abused at home. As an EMT, I was also called to multiple medical emergencies during the summer, one of which required me to do CPR. I have dealt with enough situations to be relatively un-phased when presented with something unexpected and challenging, and confidently find a solution. Finally, not only do I love being outside, but I have experience making others comfortable and excited about it as well. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>Leading a group of incoming freshman would definitely be a challenge. Hiking outside all day is exhausting, and once at the campsite my work would just be getting started. I must cook all of the food, make sure everyone is doing alright, teach the FOPers how to set up a tarp and then watch them struggle with it when it would take me half of the time, and I would be the last one to bed and the first one to wake up. It is easy to get overly stressed when in charge of a group of people in the middle of the remote wilderness, and I would have to remember that all of my training and past experiences are more than enough for me to deal with any situation I would be presented with. Furthermore, I think one of the greatest challenges would be to keep my spirits up when it is pouring rain and our firewood is not lighting, or when we took the wrong turn and didn't end up getting to the campsite until much later than we were supposed too. If you are outwardly stressed or unhappy, your FOPers will pick up on that. It is challenging to grit your teeth and put on a smile, but I think that is one of the things essential to being a FOP leader.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>	Sophomore year, I applied to be a FOP leader and was not accepted. I was disappointed, but realized that there were many more qualified applicants than there were positions. I gave up on the hopes of becoming a leader, assuming that it would not be worth it to apply as a junior, and that my chance had passed. Over Thanksgiving break, I spoke with a high school friend who lead the 7th grade outdoor trip with me, and we reminisced about how that had honestly been the best experience we had during high school. Thinking about that, I remembered why I wanted to lead FOP. I began to seriously consider applying again, and I needed to make the decision if the work of an application, two letters of recommendation, and most of all the risk of rejection, was worth it. If I was not accepted once, why would I be accepted the second time? However, I realized that if I did not apply, I would definitely not be a FOP leader. I made the decision to reapply because though I am a junior, and there are tons of qualified applicants, this is something I really want to do. I decided I was willing to take the risk and do the work to have even the possibility of getting the opportunity to lead a group of young adults into four wonderful years of their life.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5>	First off, I am concerned with Kelly, and the fact that she is shivering and giving away her desserts. I would look at what she is wearing, and if I do not think she is has enough layers I would give her one of mine or Peter's, saying "You are shivering, so you must be cold. I have this extra fleece why don't you wear it," or if she has another layer strongly suggesting that she put it on. Being cold is an easy way to loose a lot of energy, and on a hiking trip you want to conserve as much as you can. Furthermore, it worries me that she gets full easily and is not eating her desserts. With Peter's help, I would monitor how much she eats, and if we do not think it is enough, I would take her aside and speak to her about how important it is to eat enough on strenuous trips like this. Though this would be awkward, it is necessary for her health and sustenance, so I would rather speak with her about it in private than have her not eat enough.
	My next concern is Renee, who from a small town in Missouri, seems to be intimidated by Lizzie and Matilda's travels around the world. Being from Missouri myself, I would strike up a conversation with Renee about Missouri, and about the experiences of small town life. I think that Renee would have many experiences that someone from a bigger city would find interesting and unusual. I would try to have Renee, Matilda, and Lizzie engage in conversation about their experiences, and hopefully have all of them begin to realize that though people at Harvard come from a huge variety of backgrounds, no background is better or worse, they are just different. I embrace the fact that I am from Missouri, and I would like Renee to start to realize that her small town life is just as interesting as traveling to Europe, and that she should be confident and proud of her background. 
	My last concern is that the FOPers do not seem to all be on the same level - some, like Kelly and Jack, seem to be overshadowed by the rest, and Phillip seems to think he is more similar to the leaders than the other FOPers. I would try to do one or two team building activities that night that allowed the quieter FOPers to have their voice heard, and to have Phillip realize that his fellow FOPers have as much to offer as the leaders, even though they may be younger. For example, during the competition of putting up the tarps, I would make a rule that only two people from each team could speak, and the other members of the team could only do the actions that the speaker on the team directed them to do.  I would have Suzy and Jack on one team speaking, and Kelly and Daniel on the other team speaking. This has multiple benefits.  First off, Kelly and Jack are forced to speak up and take initiative in leading the group. I would hope that both themselves, and the group would realize that they have good ideas that should be heard, and that they would begin to open up a little bit more. Secondly, Suzy and Daniel, who seem to have latched onto Mark and Phillip respectively, will have to reverse positions, and be the leaders and not the followers. Perhaps this will also make Mark realize that all of the FOPers are capable, and that perhaps he does not need to take all of the weight of the group. Furthermore, Phillip will have to listen to his fellow FOPers, and hopefully recognize that he is going to be at Harvard mostly with other freshman, who though younger than him, still have a lot to offer and cannot be discounted. Though this one team building exercise will certainly not solve all of the problems, I hope that it would start to even the gaps between everyone, and put everyone on the same playing field.

		<Q7.1>1</Q7.1>
		<Q7.2>	I have always had an open mind and been very interested in learning from and meeting new people. One of the great parts of being a member of the Harvard community has been getting to know so many people from an extraordinary number of places and backgrounds. So many nights have been spent hanging out with someone very different from me, getting to know people and their backgrounds, and being constantly humbled by those around me. One of my most memorable nights was with a fellow FOPper from New Zealand, learning about a place that is very different yet similar in other ways too. This was the part of FOP that I most enjoyed, and I would love to be able to create a similar environment for my FOPpers.
	Responsibility is also one of my strong suits. Especially with organization, I usually find myself more apt to be prepared compared with others. This past summer, I went with my family on a three-week road trip. Partly by coincidence, and partly through my own initiative, I ended up planning the whole trip, from booking reservations at all of the lodging along the route, to figuring out the travel distances for each day, to planning attractions at each point during the road trip. Such tendencies to plan is especially important when organizing things like a multi-day trip through the backcountry, figuring out where to stay, and the many logistical challenges inherent in a large trip to the woods.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[	Although I have had teaching and mentoring roles throughout much of the past few years, one of the things that I continually struggle with is the more negative discipline. It is very easy for me to give positive reinforcement; it is harder for me to be stern at times to ensure that someone is following rules and procedures. From my times teaching and counseling kids, one of the most difficult parts was when there was open rejection of rules and a refusal to follow instructions that were given.
	Having to deal with social tension among FOPpers might initially be hard for me too. I tend not to do well with awkwardness, and FOP leaders are often expected to be the ones to help break the ice. I do like to meet new people, but it sometimes takes longer to fully feel comfortable with them. While that may be easier when put in a position of leadership because of the structure in place that allows FOP leaders to coordinate activities that helps create a close group, it nevertheless is a weakness for me.
	Physically, I also have some reservations about how in shape I would be for FOP. While I did do a FOP trip at a level of around B/C, it was quite taxing to hike the trails. Adding on to that the fact that a FOP leader has to be one who reassures others during hard parts of the trail makes the idea of strenuous trails daunting.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[	I was working in my room one night, when I hear shouts on Mass Ave. below. I look out and see what looks like a couple. One is lying on the floor, and the other is standing over him, shouting. He swears at his partner at times and occasionally even kicks him on the back. Every time I asked them if they were okay, the man acts normal and says that everything is fine, before going back to tormenting his partner.
	I eventually consider calling HUPD. I had never dialed the police in my life before, and so I was worried whether this constituted a worthy call. I could imagine a situation where a police response would only make the situation worse, heightening what may be just a small dispute. It also seemed like an intensely private matter that I would be asserting myself into, not to mention the essay I had due the next day. At the same time, I felt a certain responsibility to help the guy  who was being berated at. Imagining myself in his shoes, it would be a terrible feeling if no one stopped to help out of all the dozens of people who passed by them during the night. I reconciled that a small effort on my part could potentially make a huge difference for the man who was very obviously distressed. So I called the police, deciding that it couldn’t hurt, and would only stop what was starting to look like abuse.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	My first concern would be the quietness of Kelly and Jack, which suggests that either they are not yet comfortable with opening up or find it a little harder than others to do so. Especially because a lot of FOP is about getting to know the other FOPpers on a close level and being able to feel comfortable with the first group of fellow college students, it is important that Kelly and Jack are able to feel like they can be open with others around them during the trip. Although there are probably many ways to try to help them open up, I would probably do some activities with the whole FOP group, whether it is a game like ninja or learning trail songs. Anything that helps Kelly and Jack interact with the others but not in a pressured way would be the way I would go. As they grow more comfortable, one of the next nights might be a good night to try to get a close and intimate conversation going among the whole FOP group, something reminiscent of the autobiography nighttime chat.
	I would next be concerned about Renee growing quieter. It seems as though she struggles a bit with adjusting to a really diverse group of people, and she might feel intimidated by the fact that there are people around her who come from backgrounds of greater means. She may feel that she cannot connect if she herself has not been to exotic vacation spots or experienced what Lizzie and Matilda have. To help Renee with that, I would consider creating something for the FOPpers to talk about on the trail, probably lighthearted. Maybe it's to describe friends from high school or even something random like choosing a fruit that best describes yourself: anything that allows Renee connect with others, including Lizzie and Matilda, without having to fear that certain differences might hinder a friendship. With time, differences between them hopefully won't matter, and the diversity of the group may end up being a good thing, and indeed a unique part having such a varied student body.
	My third concern would be about Gage Caves. While there is a small chance that any FOPpers would like to explore there, safety is still a very important part of the trip, and ensuring that no one gets hurt is vital. Especially if some FOPpers might have motives to be alone (Mark and Suzy), keeping one eye out at the cave would ensure that that nothing dangerous happens. It wouldn't take too much effort; all it takes would be to keep track of all the FOPpers, knowing where they are and making it a point to notice if a FOPper is gone for a while. It might also mean staying up a little longer at night until the FOPpers have gone asleep or waking up once at night to check that everyone is still under the tarp if it means that the trip stays safe and no one gets hurt.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2>I am a firm believer in independent thinking, and with that, I appreciate diversity and openness. At the same time, I enjoy being part of a team. FOP fosters an accepting community where I think that my independence and enthusiasm for the outdoors would be very useful. Through my jobs and volunteer work, I have learned how to make safe and well-reasoned decisions, as well as learned valuable communicative skills. I am easygoing and optimistic, so if a problem arises on the trail, I can act in a levelheaded way without making the entire group feel stressed. Since I went on FOP just last August, I can relate well to the FOPpers, who, like I was, are often new to the backcountry. Therefore, I hopefully will be able to share the passion and respect I feel for outdoors with them. </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>Before going on FOP, I had little camping experience. As listed above, I have gone on day hikes and have been outdoors in a more informal setting fairly frequently, but outside of FOP, I have not done any camping. I think the most challenging part of being a FOP leader would be preparing before the trip so that I am comfortable and capable to lead a group of first-year students. I am confident that, with the training offered, I will be able to be a strong leader for FOP. I am really excited to learn more about the outdoors and think the process, while demanding, would definitely be rewarding. </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Last Wednesday at around noon, I got an email from the Harvard Outing Club listserve announcing an “Ugly Christmas Sweater” day hike to Mt. Cardigan on Friday. Sign up for the trip closed at 5pm. I had joined the email list in mid-November, a late start for the Outing Club season, but nevertheless I had already gone on an easygoing beach hike to Ipswich. Friday was the first day after my classes had ended and was a good day for me to start cracking down on all my end-of-semester work. However, I had not been off campus since Thanksgiving and my reading period stress was augmented in the Harvard Bubble. As I went to my afternoon classes, the prospect of getting outside sounded more and more appealing. After I got back to my room, I rifled through my drawers, found my Christmas sweater, adorned with an enormous sequined wreath and signed up for the trip. It was absolutely the right decision. At the top of Mt. Cardigan (after an obligatory ugly Christmas sweater peak picture) Ben and Anna, the leaders of the trip and also both FOP leaders, suggested we have a minute of silence on top of the mountain. During those moments with thick fog obscuring any real view, I realized how not only rewarding, but necessary, my choice to escape Cambridge for the day was. Though, if I fail any of my exams, I may wish I had considered other factors…]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Firstly, I would address the health and safety of the FOPpers. Mark’s extra burden of group and personal gear is worrisome because it is a physical concern for him while hiking. When FOPpers split up group gear, I would be particularly cognizant of the size of each pile to make sure everyone was truly getting equal shares of the weight. In addition, Kelly’s shivering and giving away of food is a health concern. On FOP, she is burning a lot of calories, so she needs to drink and eat enough to keep her healthy and energized. If Mark continues to take extra gear and Kelly keeps giving away her food, I would talk with them both privately and in a casual manner about how, even though their actions are really generous, they need to put their own safety first.

Secondly, once all the FOPpers had gone off to bed, I would check with Peter to solidify our plans for the next day. I would look closely the route for tomorrow and go over our specific plans in order to avoid any more directional mishaps, as well as discuss how the trip was going so far. For the next day, I would have more leader/leader meetings during water breaks while hiking to check our pace and confirm our route. If Peter and I are communicating effectively, the trip is more likely to go smoothly for both the FOPpers and us. While leading a FOP trip, it is important to realize that you are not the sole navigator for the group of first years; you and your co-leader have the responsibility to set a positive tone and direct your group of FOPpers through the backcountry safely. If the two leaders can work together well, challenges on the trail get much more manageable. 

Lastly, I would try and address the group dynamic as a whole by talking about what to expect freshman year. The conversation would allow everyone to learn more about each other and move beyond the superficial. Being a freshman at Harvard is at least one thing the whole group has in common. This factor can become an equalizer even though each individual is vastly different. Obviously, Harvard is a really diverse place; the FOPpers will definitely meet more Phillips; at some point in time, Renee will probably again feel isolated about her rural upbringing, but all freshman will have to navigate through the rock-hard rolls and the too-watery oatmeal in Annenberg. They will all be confused and frenzied about how exactly to tackle Shopping Week. By talking about the group’s expectations, fears and questions about the upcoming year, they will be able to see how the common freshman experience can bring them together and there is no better place to do that than sitting in the backcountry around a couple of headlamp/Nalgene lanterns.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[	My ability to foster an open, caring, and honest environment would serve me well as a FOP leader. My FOP leaders’ greatest asset was their ability to act as both a leader and a friend at the same time, and my experience on the trip lent me some of their genuine enthusiasm for authentically connecting with others. The beginning of the first year can be intimidating for incoming first-year students, and I would be able to help them step back and reevaluate what they’re about to begin in a way that personalizes the experience for them. I try to approach every person I meet, to borrow a phrase from one of my favorite books, motivated by curiosity and kindness. Harvard can seem like an impersonal monolith, and I would do my best to show my first-years that they and their friendships are what really make Harvard worthwhile.
	While it may seem a tad trite, my ability to help them be themselves going into their first-year would also be invaluable. The beginning of college is great, because no one knows what any social expectations are, and so no one has any mold to which they feel they must conform, and as a FOP leader I would accentuate this beautiful lack of set social structure. My goal for my trip would be for each one of my FOPers to leave feeling like the best thing they could do is to be thoroughly themselves.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[	My greatest challenge as a FOP leader would be dealing with the multitude of personalities that I would inevitably find in my group. One of the great things about FOP is that a given trip will have a solid sampling of the many types of people who make up Harvard. While I have in my head the Platonic ideal of a FOPer, I am a tad unsure as to how I would deal with a group of eight or so FOPers where I would have to be both the leader for each individual and the group as a whole. I hope (and believe) that this would resolve itself organically and that as I seek to help each FOPer connect authentically the issue of leading the individual and the group would dissolve.
	Another concern I would have is having to be “on” for an entire week. I consider myself to be a person with very good stamina and mental equilibrium, but having to be in a leader role continuously for an entire week could be challenging. Thinking back on my FOP trip, I am very impressed by my leaders’ abilities to be great leaders for the entire trip, even when we arrive back into camp after dark, dead tired, and in the rain. Their greatest virtue, I think, is that they loved what they were doing, so it did not seem like a job at all, and I think it would be like that for me.
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>At the Harvard-Yale game this year, I faced a decision that was symbolic of an issue I had been struggling with all fall. The sailing team is a very social group, and it becomes the main friend group of many of its members. I loved the team, but I had other friends that were people who would more naturally be my friends than the sailing team. All fall I had been unsure as to how much time to devote to everybody, but going into the Game, I was trending more and more towards my non-sailing friends. I was with the sailing team Friday night and Saturday morning, but once I got inside the stadium one of my other friends texted me to come hang out with them. I thought for a couple of seconds, and then left to go meet up with them, and then stayed with them for the rest of the weekend.
	The decision ended up being relatively easy in the end: I thought my non-sailing friends were those with whom I would organically be friends. I loved the sailing team, and they will always be close friends, but at the end of the day I weighed what I thought I would do in absence of a preset social structure like the sailing team more than the familiarity bred by spending a lot of time with the team. My only regret is that I did not make the decision earlier, as dedicating my time to those with whom I felt most comfortable being my authentic self was the best decision I ever made.
</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	Kelly and Jack’s reticence around the rest of the group is, I think, the most pressing issue presented in this trip. The most valuable thing that I got out of FOP was a healthy dose of self-confidence to connect authentically with everyone, and without the ability to do that Kelly and Jack’s trips would largely have been wasted. I would do a few things to help them realize that they are worth putting themselves out there and to facilitate them making those connections. I would personally try to spend more time actively engaging Jack and Kelly in conversation, showing them just how interesting and awesome people they are, and how much they have to offer. I would also then do more group activities that would provide them with the opportunities to connect with others, like mixing up groups for tasks at camp and doing an evening activity where everyone has to put themselves out there and make themselves feel closer to and more comfortable with the group.
	I feel that Renee is experiencing a similar yet slightly different problem. She is experiencing a discomfort with connecting on account of her different socioeconomic background. My goal as a FOP leader would be to facilitate people connecting authentically not in spite of or ignoring their diverse backgrounds and situations growing up, but taking each person for who they are without judgment, as each person’s background is an intrinsic part of them. Here I would try to help Renee realize that her experiences and background are just as valuable as those of Lizzie and Mathilda. Again, I would talk to her on the trail about anything and everything, getting to know her better and showing her just how interesting and awesome she is. I would then try group activities that would accentuate this. One that comes to mind from my FOP trip is Kicked Butt/Butt Kicked, because it would emphasize just how monumental and valuable even the smallest experience can be.
	I see the inverse problem in the situation with Phillip and Daniel. They both place great emphasis on exotic and seemingly vast experiences and construe them as a mark of what they perceive to be mature. My goal would then be to help them realize the equal value that lies in smaller experiences and rethink their preconceived notions of what it means to be mature. Given how much Phillip talks with Peter, I would talk to Peter about him talking with Phillip about spending more time with the rest of the group and how much they have to offer. I would also make an effort to structure things such as the hiking order and the tasks in camp so that he and Daniel get to know the other FOPers better. I would then also use some group activities to help them realize the value of the others’ experiences and their varying, and perhaps more correct evaluations of what maturity is. If Daniel’s comments about wanting to “get trashed” with Phillip persist, I would have a word with him about how that talk may not be FOPproriate and about the diverse approaches to drinking at Harvard.

		<Q7.2>I view myself as someone who is curious, warm, compassionate, and funny - a loyal friend, a rationalist, and an adventurer. I think a FOP leader needs to be able to incorporate and access all of those characteristics in order to lead a group successfully. Certainly leading a group of people requires more than just being gregarious; one must understand the complexities of each individual and the group dynamic as a whole. While being able to connect with and talk to people has always come naturally to me, I am equally proud of my ability to empathize with others and I have loved the outdoors since childhood. Guiding a group of first-years in the wilderness is not an easy task, but I really enjoy being a leader. I like motivating people and pushing them to the edge of and slightly beyond their comfort zones. I enjoy facilitating groups of people and have experience doing so in different situations. Aside from character traits, I believe I would help first-year students acclimate to Harvard through FOP because I so vividly remember my own doubt and anticipation before FOP. Recognizing this nervous excitement within the group will be critical to fostering a sense of community, trust, and awareness. Overall, my curiosity about people, my caring about others and my appreciation of the wilderness are my greatest strengths for leading FOP.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[If I were to lead a group, I see three particular challenges: my desire to please others, my frustration when things do not going according to plan, and the high standards I place on myself. Since I want others to be happy and enjoy themselves, it might be difficult for me to have to prevent a FOPper from doing something that I know is wrong or dangerous, because I would not want the FOPper to get mad at me or be upset. It is not always easy for me to disappoint or let others down. Another challenge is that I am somewhat of a perfectionist; I really enjoy order, planning, and things happening in a particular way. Yet, it is quite plausible that at many points on a FOP trip something will occur that will cause the group to deviate from the established plan. In past leadership situations, I have been challenged to “go with the flow” at these times but still managed to regroup and move forward. Lastly, I place pressure on myself to do a job well, so I can be self-critical or visibly disappointed when things ‘go wrong’. While leading a FOP trip would challenge me in these areas, I also think that it would offer tremendous rewards and opportunities that I feel ready to embrace, and while saying “no” can be challenging, I know that the safety of the individual and the group always has to come first.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>The summer after my sophomore year of high school, I went on a 5-week program in Peru. A major aspect of the trip was constructing a community center in a small village named Munaypata with the families who lived there and hosted us. I felt extremely passionate about contributing to the project and wanted to see it completed before I left. Three other group members felt differently: they rarely helped with the manual labor and frequently complained about the work, slowing the process down. The entire group already had a tenuous dynamic and was not very cohesive. I was really torn about how to proceed. Should I confront those individuals who were not pulling their weight in order to achieve my goal of finishing the project and risk further group division? I reflected on the wishes of the Munaypata community members, many of whom set aside their farming jobs in order to help create this project. Further, I attempted to gauge the varying opinions of the rest of my group about finishing the community center and how they perceived the work ethic of the three members in question. Ultimately, I decided to speak up at a group meeting, but instead of singling out any individual, I spoke about my deep wish to complete the project and my fundamental hope that others felt similarly. Surprisingly, almost the entire group felt the same way. After the meeting, everyone began contributing with more enthusiasm, grew closer as a group, and completed the center</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[As we approach the end of the third day, I have three primary concerns: the group’s overall level of cohesion and trust, the level of contribution by each FOPper, and my communication with Peter and the implications for group safety. The group seems to lack cohesiveness since it appears to be fractured into a few clusters of friendships. This dynamic can make people feel excluded, which I fear has happened to Renee, and may be true for Daniel as well. I worry about the group’s current social construction. Having the FOPpers trust each other and the leaders is critical for success tomorrow, with its challenging terrain, and ultimately the trip as well. If people are struggling, they need to be comfortable enough to speak up, which I worry Daniel won’t do in an attempt to impress Phillip, nor will Kelly (safety concern) or Jack because of their personalities. To resolve this, I would check in with Peter about my observations and propose that during dinner we have a group discussion about the day, transitioning into a conversation about tomorrow.  
While it’s not necessarily a problem if FOPpers participate to varying degrees, I am worried that certain people are not buying into the group mentality, or are doing it too much. Although it’s great that Mark wants to be so helpful, he is putting himself at risk and not allowing others to partake in valuable activities. Also, Phillip is not attentive enough to his fellow FOPpers, which might become contagious. To address this growing problem, I would consult with Peter first and then have a quick conversation, most likely the following morning, with Phillip about what is moving in him as well as one with Mark, expressing gratitude for his leadership and work ethic but acknowledging that maybe others would like to help out too. 
After dinner, I’d suggest that the FOPpers put on some layers while Peter and I clean up. As we cleaned up, I would check in with Peter. I would want to bring up my concerns about lack of communication between us, and the emotional and physical safety of the group. I would go over the wrong turn, clear up my lack of clarity about his feelings about Phillip, ask why he brought up the Gage Caves to the group since they are fairly far away from camp and using the word ‘dangerous’ will only pique the group’s interest, get a clarification about his motives for announcing the competition without consulting with me first, share my concerns about the group, and check in about his priorities and hopes for the last few days. Peter and I need to be on the same page at all times, and it concerns me that I have so many uncertainties about what he’s thinking. During this chat, I’d also bring up tomorrow, specifically how the group might need some motivation and breaks. I’d also suggest we do some activities while hiking to address my worry about group cohesiveness.

Summer 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012: week-long hiking trips with my family. We went to Tetons National Park, Zion National Park, and Arches! It was so fun!
August 2013: I was a FOPper!! Switch-service trip A/B (Yeah FOP 72!)]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Summer 2009: I volunteered as an assistant teacher in an "English as a Second Language" class for my school district's summer school program. For six weeks I taught children in first through sixth grade how to read and write. I also led the class in many fun interactive activities (I LOVE improv!)
School year 2010-2012: I volunteered as a dance teacher in a dance class for children with cerebral palsy for two years. The class met once a week and ran from August to May. I assisted children one-on-one in learning simple dance steps and stretches as part of their physical therapy. I absolutely loved working with these children, who were ages 7 to 18. 
School year 2013-2014: I am currently in CityStep, an organization on campus that teaches inner city fifth, sixth, and seventh graders how to dance. I go to the classroom twice a week for an hour and half and teach the children new dance moves, improv games, and other interactive creative activities!
School year 2012-2013: I was the editor in chief of my high school's newspaper. This experience taught me so much about being a good leader, especially when dealing with my own peers. I was able to hone in my organization skills and work towards a deadline, while also making sure to have fun!]]></Q6.2>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think I can bring a sense of both responsibility and fun to the group. In my past experiences as a leader, I have always made sure to balance the necessary amount of business and fun. For example, when I volunteered as a teacher in a class for children with cerebral palsy, I always made sure the children were receiving the necessary physical therapy treatment while also making sure to play their favorite songs (I always took requests). I try to stay positive as much as possible, and especially in tough times, I am definitely one to turn to for reassurance and just a smile. I love mentoring others and sharing my own experiences. With my broad range of interests (theater, journalism, medicine, dance...) I am able to relate to many people of different backgrounds and make sure the first-year students feel prepared and confident going into freshman year.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>I think my greatest challenge in leading a group of first-year students would just be the "outdoorsy" aspect. I am not particularly accustomed to the outdoors, but I absolutely loved FOP. One of my leaders last year was deathly scared of spiders and had just learned to swim, yet he was totally calm and collected the whole time and really brought other strengths to the group. I feel that my strengths lie in my positivity, perseverance, and overall outgoing nature. FOP for me was so much more than the hiking and trail work. FOP was about starting over again, getting comfortable with complete strangers despite the nerves and insecurities, only made possible by the isolated setting. Although I am not the most outdoorsy person, I also think that not all FOPpers are that way either. Having a leader who squealed at the site of spiders made me more comfortable with not being so comfortable in the outdoors. I want to be that for someone. </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[In the spring of my junior year of high school, I tore my meniscus. I was on crutches for six weeks, conveniently during the time of a science competition I was involved in. I was the captain of a team of ten of my peers and we had been practicing for this competition for nearly three months. The accident happened only a week before the competition was to be held. I had surgery two days before the competition day. I made the difficult decision to go to the competition because I felt that even if I was on pain killers and crutches, I needed to be there for my team. We had worked too hard to get this far and my knee was not going to stop me from competing. My dad drove me separately (crutches are a pain on a cramped school bus), and after a five hour competition, my team took first in the state. Although this was a difficult situation, the answer was clear to me as both a leader and a competitor: I had worked too hard to let my knee stop me from being there for my team. In the end, my decision was a good one and I am so glad I was able to persevere and overcome the great inconvenience for the sake of the group.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[In this situation, I would be most worried about Renee not having a very positive experience, Peter beginning to not be a very supportive leader, and Kelly not doing well health-wise. In regards to Renee being left out, I would make sure to engage her in as much conversation as possible when she is walking behind me on the trail. I will make sure to pay attention to the things she says that make her unique in order to highlight the cool aspects of Renee in front of the other FOPpers so that Lizzie and Matilda start to include her. The reason why I’d be concerned about Renee not having a positive experience is because FOP should be about inclusivity. If Renee suddenly feels excluded, she may not have the confidence to push her way into Lizzie and Matilda’s conversation because she is most likely already a little insecure about meeting strangers on this trip. Although you cannot really stop people from being friends, you can include someone yourself. 
In regards to Peter, I think this is a lesser problem, but I would probably talk to him about not looking outwardly annoyed at Phillip. Although Phillip is extremely talkative and it might be sort of frustrating, Peter should remain positive and understand that Phillip probably just wants to look cool in front of Peter. Phillip even says that he feels most comfortable around Peter, so Peter should be more friendly. Although an eye roll is not a huge deal, Peter could soon snap at Phillip out of frustration and that would be a bad situation. So I think it would probably be best to talk to Peter and tell him I saw his outward annoyance and it should stop.
Kelly is possibly not eating enough or is sick. The fact that she is not very communicative and shakes during breaks indicates that someone should seek her out and ask her how she is feeling. I would probably first make a game out of drinking water or finishing the peanut butter to make sure that she is eating enough no matter how many cookies she gives away. If the problem persists, I would probably take her aside and ask her if everything all rights. If she refuses to eat more, the problem could be grounds for sending Kelly home. I would tell her that I noticed she is shaking a little and she is not eating very much and then I would ask what I could do to make her feel better. She might just be nervous. 
Moving forward, I would use the tarp competition to create groups of the kids that break down the cliques that are forming to foster communication between everyone. I would adjust the groups for setting up the tarps to be Renee with Lizzie or Matilda. I would separate Matilda and Lizzie and put one of them with Mark instead of having Suzy with Mark. I would put Daniel with Mark because they both seem like they would get along, based on personalities in the scenario.

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Religious Education Teacher (2009-2012) 
Field Hockey Co-Captain (2011-2012): The two years I was co-captain were really important in developing my leadership skills and would definitely translate over if I was to be a FOP leader. The first reason for this was because field hockey was my life in high school, and leading the team was my first priority. We tried a lot of new things and team bonding activities that ultimately took us farther in playoffs than we had in over a decade. Secondly, I was always a co-captain. My first year I was with an older girl and I learned how to delegate tasks and to split responsibility, as well as work well with another leader without stepping on her toes. I was challenged to utilize that skill during my second year as co-captain with a girl I didn’t particularly get along with. This was also a valuable experience because we still managed to lead a great team and put our personal differences aside to reach a common goal. Accomplishing that was really important to me.
Resident Camp Counselor (Summer 2011)
MUN Undersecretary General (2012)
AD in UNODC (2012-2013): I am on staff for a model UN conference in New York City that I attended all 4 years of high school. As a freshman I was an assistant director and had to prepare for the conference, and more specifically for my committee, with my director for 8 months before the conference. While that was difficult, the most difficult part was finding a balance on the dais about what role we were each going to play and how we were going to maintain order but also have fun in committee. We ended up doing a really good job with that according to what our delegates told us after the conference, and were very successful with all we had to accomplish during committee. This position definitely challenged me and pushed me past where I thought I could go, which made me stronger and more confident in my leadership abilities.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think that I have a lot of qualities that would help me lead a group of first year students. Obviously they are nervous about the fact that as soon as they step out of the woods they will be in college, so the most important things that they need are comfort and information. I am fairly involved in campus life and I love Harvard, so I would love to talk about school and what they will want/need to know before they are thrown into it. I am also a fun, bubbly, outgoing, and likeable (I would like to think) person, which I think would help me become friends with them and foster a positive environment in which they can become friends with each other. I just want to have fun and I think I could make FOP even more of a blast for my FOPpers.
Finally, I know some of them will be nervous that they won’t be able to keep up or just that they are in the woods. I think I am relatable and easily approachable which is necessary for making a group of incoming freshman be willing to follow you into the woods for a week. While I am bubbly I am by no means ditzy, and I think it’s important that a FOP leader seem (and obvious be) responsible and capable of handling any potential situation that comes along. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My greatest challenge, which my own FOP leaders did an incredible job with, would be to make such a diverse group of kids connect to each other. That is something that you can’t force and really have to create an environment for, which has to be fostered from day one. I would be nervous that someone was feeling left out or not enjoying themselves, and making sure that that didn’t happen would certainly be a challenge. I think I would also be challenged by the fact that there will be a group of people looking to me for direction and answers, and that is a lot of pressure. However, I think while these would be challenges for me they are nothing I wouldn’t be able to handle.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[This morning I had to decide if I should wear my brown boots or my patterned flats. I had a few factors to consider, such as the temperature, whether or not I would see my dining-hall-crush during lunch, which shoes I had worn more recently, and which matched better with my sweater. Ultimately, I decided I should wear the flats because it was warmer than it had recently been outside, I probably would see my dining-hall-crush since I have come to know when he is usually eating lunch (not creepy I promise), and I had just worn my boots yesterday. However, now as I sit writing this application I am texting my friends to see if anyone has bandaids nearby because I did not consider the crucial fact that I had yet to wear these shoes in and that they were going to subsequently destroy my feet. I also didn’t consider that it was raining and that the flats are suede. So ultimately I made the wrong decision because I chose fashion over function, which my mom says is a major no-no, and I didn’t incorporate some of the most important factors like my comfort/absence of pain and the well-being of my clothing. Furthermore, I didn’t appropriately weigh the factors that I did consider, such as the idea that my dining-hall-crush would prefer one pair of shoes over the other or that anyone would notice that I just wore my brown boots yesterday.   ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[1) Renee being left out:
I think the first issue to be addressed is that Renee feels left out. These are all ~18 year olds so you cannot force them to like who they don’t like… not like you can ever really do that. However, you can try to steer away from divisive conversations that leave people out, such as different upbringings. I would work on fostering group conversations during breaks or finding common ground between Renee and other FOPpers. Like I previously mentioned, you can’t force anything, but it would be best to facilitate finding other topics of conversation or common ground.

2) Phillip not connecting with the other FOPpers:
This is definitely a problem because Phillip appears to have an elevated sense of self since he graduated a year before everyone else. The fact that Phillip isn’t connect with anyone else his age isn’t only a problem during FOP but also when he gets to school, which is something I definitely wouldn’t want to happen. As a leader I would try to remind him subtly that a lot of students take gap years and maybe steer him towards Lizzy and Matilda because they would be able to bond over their travels. Maybe it would help Phillip realize that he has had similar experiences to his peers and thus doesn’t have that much more of a mature outlook. 

3) Peter not being respectful of the FOPpers:
Although Phillip is being pushy, Peter’s behavior towards him is concerning. He is in a leadership position and, as such, cannot outwardly show disdain for a FOPper. If Phillip were to ever see Peter rolling his eyes he would be crushed. It would make the rest of FOP difficult for us leaders in maintaining their respect and trust. Furthermore, it would make FOP difficult for Phillip. Being in the woods for a week is uncomfortable to begin with, but that is exacerbated by the fact that Phillip doesn’t know anyone very well and now knows even his leader doesn’t like him. I would address this issue by speaking to Peter. I think it’s important that we have a relationship where we can tell teach other our concerns, even if it is awkward. I would just point out that I wasn’t sure if I had seen the eye roll or not but that Peter should make sure not to show outwardly how he is feeling about Phillip or any other FOPper. It is their trip, not ours, and we really have to keep that in mind. I would try to help him guide Phillip towards some other FOPpers; If Phillip respects Peter so much and thinks he has such a mature point of view, he will be much more inclined to listen to Peter if he was to say “Kelly was telling me something fascinating today… you should speak to her about it.” That would show that Peter respected Kelly’s point of view and so should Phillip.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[During spring semester 2013, I participated in semester-long FOP training.  As a switch trip trainee, I learned to perfect my SHLOP MOP while lighting stoves in the rain behind Pennypacker.  I became a certified in CPR and lifeguarding, and practiced knots and debrief skills.

Additionally, over the summer I spend time sea kayaking and whitewater kayaking with a inexperienced friend.  Helping him learn how to manage his boat, how to roll, how to read rapids, etc gave me practice teaching others skills that I occasionally take for granted (see my response to the question about my weaknesses).

Finally, and most notably, I took a calendar year off of school.  I left for personal reasons in late April, and plan on returning in January.  Since then I have spent time getting to know myself.  I have lived my sister, worked in a dive bar, and spent time fighting for civil rights.  I represent an alternative to the cut and dried four year Harvard experience- I’ve taken a path different from the straight-though paradigm that many freshmen are presented with.  It is important for FOP leaders to represent diversity of thought and experience.  This independence and critical thinking would serve as an asset to my trip.  If you have any questions or concerns about my leave of absence, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[My greatest strength in leading a group of first-years lies in my capacity to listen and respond to their concerns.  As a former camp counselor and as a current peer counselor, I have learned to pay close attention to the subtle comments and actions that people make.  

Often, FOPpers (and co-leaders) are upfront with their needs.  Sometimes, however, people are unwilling or unable to vocalize their concerns.  In a wilderness setting, it is extremely important to be aware of physical concerns (dehydration, hypothermia, overexertion…) and emotional concerns (eating concerns, isolation, homesickness...) as soon as they arise, to prevent a small concern from becoming a potentially dangerous, catastrophic problem.  What may simply seem like someone being quiet may well be an indicator of feelings of isolation or exhaustion that would be best if monitored and proactively addressed.

In order to maximize the experience for FOPpers, it is extremely important to pay close attention to their mental, emotional, and physical well-being.  FOP marks a crucial transition phase for incoming students, and my awareness of students’ mental and emotional states both during and after the trip will allow me to respond in a timely and appropriate manner to both private and voiced concerns.  I am comfortable addressing concerns as they arise whether with FOPpers, co-leaders, or any other unexpected challenges.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think my greatest challenge in leading a group of first-years lies in the extreme diversity of experience.  Inevitably, some FOPpers have never backpacked before; some may have led trips.  This disparity in skill and comfort level can be challenging to manage as a group leader.  

Specifically, I imagine working with students with no outdoor experience would present a unique challenge.  I grew up very comfortable in the outdoors and may have trouble identifying with people who haven’t spent more than 12 continuous hours outside.  There are so many little tips and tricks of the outdoors that become second nature over time, and are easy to forget to mention to someone who is just learning how to interact in this environment.  I have no qualms with pooping in the woods and no fear of bugs.  This might make it challenging for me to interact with FOPpers who aren’t used to getting dirty and embracing trail spice.

Additionally, I think an important challenge is finding a style of communication and feedback that works well with my co-leader.  I know how important feedback is, as is finding the best time and manner for sharing that is crucial to the success of a co-leading team.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[In May 2012, I was heading to Morocco.  I’d be traveling by myself to Fez, one of the old imperial capital cities.  I’d packed my Middle East appropriate clothing, my camera, my running shoes.  Looking through my travel documents the day of my flight I realized that I hadn’t received a confirmation notice from the Arabic program I was hoping to study at in Fez.  I was all dressed up and all excited with literally nowhere to go.  At this point, a number of concerns were running through my head: should I stay home? Should I go anyway?  Will I be admitted into the program if I just show up?  If the program falls through, where will I stay?  Is it safe to be a blonde woman traveling around Morocco alone? 
 
My greatest concern was safety.  I love adventures more than anything, but I am unwilling to make unsafe choices.  No matter how fun traipsing around Morocco alone would be, I was unwilling to put myself in danger.  Having considered safety, finances, and logistics, I determined that my travel plans were not dangerous and committed to the trip whole heartedly.  I’m glad I went, itchy camels and all.  In retrospect, I wish I would have reached out to people I know both here and abroad to gather more information about Morocco, traveling alone, and developing itineraries on the fly.  I wish I would have developed a more thorough contingency plan (although the program worked out in the end).]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My three most pressing concerns about this FOP trip are Kelly’s potential eating concerns, Renee’s disengagement, and creating an internally focused, collaborative, inclusive FOP environment.  

In this scenario, Kelly’s actions struck me as a big red flag.  While shivering could simply be mean she’s cold when she rests, and while giving away her cookies could mean she’s simply generous, I’m very concerned by what I see as clear and present indicators of eating concerns.  It seems possible that Kelly is intentionally trying to cut calories by giving away her desserts.  It also appears that she may be trying to maximize caloric burn by being extra active and by purposefully being cold.   Kelly’s behavior puts her at risk for a whole host of concerns pertinent to FOP, chief among them exhaustion from insufficient caloric intake and hypothermia.  It is difficult if not impossible to enjoy the powerful FOP experience when you are freezing and starving.  Furthermore, if unaddressed Kelly’s behavior could turn into a severe body dysmorphia or even a full-blown eating concern when she returns to campus.  Eating concerns, though found in every demographic, are particularly prevalent in females and often develop during the first year of college.   To address this I would consider initiating a proactive non-judgmental conversation with Kelly (if appropriate) about how she views her body and what stressors may be present in her life.  I would monitor the situation carefully and have a more directive conversation if necessary upon our return to campus.

I’m also concerned about Renee’s level of engagement.  After conversations related to socioeconomic status and politics, she has been much more quiet.  This isn’t something I would speak to her or the other girls directly about.  Rather, I would initiate a conversation with the trip about differences in opinion and experience, perhaps during a debrief.  Difference in background and opinion on campus can often be overwhelming and is a good thing to be cognizant of.  I might mention a phrase I find very handy: step up step back.  This simply means that those that find themselves doing and saying less (like Renee and Jack) might want to pitch in and pipe up more, while others (like Mark and Philip) pipe down a bit and let other FOPpers help more.

Finally, I’d like for the trip to be a more collaborative and inclusive.  As leaders, it is our responsibility to make sure that the trip doesn’t feel competitive.  While exchanging feedback with Peter I would ask about his earlier comments about the tarp building competition.  I felt that it was inappropriate to bring an element of competition to our trip, as FOPpers might benefit more from a collaborative experience.  (While talking to Peter, I might also mention his treatment of the Gage Caves.  Framing the caves as dangerous and forbidden could well have piqued the interest of our trip, especially adventurous Philip who looks up to Peter.  Their safety is our number one priority, and FOPpers shouldn’t take unnecessary risks in the dark.)

		<Q6.1>2009-Present: Every spring I spend 6 days a week on the water in all sorts of conditions, including the snow, wind, heat, and rain. As a coxswain, I am responsible for the safety of eight rowers and to make sure they are staying hydrated, healthy, and strong. 
August 2013: FOP trip. I was an enthusiastic FOPper who loved helping set up camp, sorting group gear, and bonding with the group.
FOP was my first real experience with the backcountry and I absolutely loved stepping out of my comfort zone. It taught me so much about the world, and myself, and I hope to continue that process and also lead others through it in the future.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I am a very energetic person who loves interacting with people. I’ve always felt very comfortable in leadership positions, and because of my coxswaining background, I know how to delegate responsibilities.I'm also a team player which would help the relationship with my co-leader. In addition, I believe in building strong relationships. I would always be a resource and a friend for my FOPpers well after the trip ends. I had such a life-changing experience on FOP that I want to be able to help make that happen for others. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>I think one of the greatest challenges in leading a FOP group would be keeping morale high in tough situations, like if the group is very tired but we still have a ways to go, we get lost on the trail, or bad weather strikes at an inopportune time. Another challenge would be making sure everyone in the group is engaged, feels like a valuable member of the group, and comfortable in this foreign situation.
</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[My senior year of high school, I had to decide whether I wanted to fight for a spot on the varsity 8 or if I should pass up the opportunity to stay with the second varsity boat. It was a very conflicting dilemma for many reasons. On the one hand, I wanted to challenge into the boat because I was meant to have the seat when I became a senior and I didn’t want to let a group of catty, meddling girls win by having their friend as coxswain instead of me. But by not letting them win, I was condemning myself to a miserable season because I would be surrounded by unkind people. If I passed up the opportunity to compete for the seat, I would have a boat of great girls and a coach I highly respected, and who respected me in return. I knew if I were on varsity, I would dread practice every day. The appeal of “varsity” only goes so far; the status would mean nothing to me because I wouldn't be enjoying my time. I decided that my happiness was more important than the prestige of the title, and I stuck with the second eight. In the end, the girls got what they wanted; I wasn’t their coxswain. But I was the winner, not them, because I had a more fun, enjoyable, and successful season than I could ever wish for.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[In the scenario, my main three concerns are the group getting adequate rest before their challenging hike the next day, Kelly’s health, and Renee’s behavior. 

I think getting a good night of sleep is crucial because the FOPpers are likely exhausted after their long day, and they have an even more challenging day ahead of them. Hiking the trails can be very dangerous if one is not well-rested, especially trails with difficult terrain. To ensure the group gets adequate sleep I would make sure that after dinner everyone helps to clean up and prepare for bed quickly. Before bed I would have the group reflect on the trip thus far as well as what they’re looking forward to and what they think will be challenging on their next day of hiking. This activity would help wind everyone down as well as mentally prepare them for the next day.

I believe Kelly’s health is a definite concern; it doesn’t sound like she is eating enough and her shivering is not normal. Extensive exercise is not safe when one’s health is jeopardized, and could lead to much bigger health concerns. I would pull Kelly aside to talk to her about her health and explain how important it is to take care of your body in the wilderness and when exercising. I would then discuss the situation with Peter to decide the best plan of action. 

Another concern of mine is Renee—it seems she has become very uncomfortable about her modest upbringing. I think it is a problem because her behavior has changed dramatically from chatting on the trails to barely answering direct questions. It is important that everyone on FOP has the best experience possible, and such is not the case for Renee. I think a group discussion on how each person is a valuable part of the group could help Renee to realize that she is no less important because she doesn’t come from money. Hopefully after the discussion, all 9 FOPpers will feel like a valued and appreciated member of the group.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[While I’ve had fewer opportunities to get outside and lead trips compared to my gap year, this past year has offered me more insight into Harvard and how the outdoors fits into the college experience.  The majority of my outdoors experiences while on campus have been through the Harvard Outing Club.  Joining HOC brought me together with other HOC leaders, people who love the outdoors and have a lot of outdoors experience.  But HOC trips are generally geared towards getting the entire Harvard community outdoors, so it also exposed me to people who haven’t had the chance to have the same experiences.  This has helped me open my mind and think of the things that had seemed obvious but require extra attention or explaining for those who lack outdoors experience.  My time on the HOC board has also given me ample time to explore what people at Harvard can gain from outdoors experiences.  In addition to simply being fun, they offer a break from the otherwise all-too hectic Harvard lifestyle.  It’s amazing to see new participants appreciate the opportunity, and to hear them say that they never realized the ways that a trip could add to their Harvard experience.]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think my greatest strengths will be my extensive outdoor experience, especially in leadership of outdoor youth programs.  I have been in a leadership role in the outdoors for years.  I was a Boy Scout, and active in my troop, rising all the way to Eagle Scout.  I also was active in my high-school’s outing club, and was a co-head of the club for two years.  In high school I discovered my passion for kayaking, and began helping out with the program I learned with.  I ended up working for Liquid Adventures Kayak School as an instructor, both the after school program and summer camps.  I also joined the HOC and am now on the board as a gear manager.  This experience has given me a lot of hard skills, but also experience teaching those skills to others.  In addition it’s taught me to think of safety in an outdoors mindset, taking into account as many factors as possible, including ability to provide aid, distance to help, and possibility of weather shifts. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>My greatest challenge will probably be the orientation aspect.  Most of my experience has been largely focused on building excitement and appreciation for the outdoors.  I think it will be an interesting change of pace to also place a greater emphasis on the Harvard community as a whole and use the outdoor experience to prepare new freshman.  I know FOP gave me a unique opportunity to both learn about Harvard and myself and I hope I can give that to future freshmen.  My previous year both as a Harvard student and as a HOC member have given me some new perspectives on life at Harvard, including ways to incorporate the outdoors into your Harvard experience and simply ways to improve the experience as a whole.  I hope the FOP training program will help me be able to transfer those lessons to incoming freshmen.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I was on a kayaking trip with some friends. The first rapid on a river led into sixty-foot slide.  The moves themselves didn’t look very hard, but the consequences for messing up would most likely mean scraping your face down the entire slide.  In the worst-case scenario, we were close to our cars and not far from civilization and medical help.  As a group, we took a close look at each part.  I made sure that I knew I could make all the moves required.  One friend decided to walk around and set up safety at the bottom.  As an experienced paddler in the group, my friends looked to me.  The rapid looked really fun, and I was pretty certain that I could do it without making a mistake, and I thought the fun-to-risk ratio was worth it for myself.  I then considered how my decision would affect the others in my group.  Two were mature enough to make their own judgment calls.  The other two were younger, and I wasn’t as sure of their ability to judge the situation.  I decided to go ahead and run the rapid, but took a moment to run the younger guys through my thought process and re-iterate that just because others may run it successfully doesn’t mean it will go well for them, and that they can walk it now and paddle it another time.  I paddled it and had a blast, and the other guys also ran it and were fine.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[1.	While the group’s safety generally seems to be at a good place, I would want to address Kelly’s situation and the caves.  While being cold hasn’t seemed to affect her outlook, it could be a problem, especially considering that we just went through a rainstorm and her clothes might be wet. The fact that Kelly is also not eating all of her food is probably making things worse.  I would make sure that she has enough warm dry layers and tell her to start layering on the warmer side, as well as encourage her to eat a little more of her own food as we have a long day ahead and she’ll need the energy.  Depending on exactly how dangerous and interesting the caves are, I might take efforts to ensure that people don’t try to go exploring there themselves or offer to lead a quick supervised trip in the morning in order to satiate curiosity.
2.	While it’s great that Mark is being so helpful, I’m worried that he is trying too hard, especially if he is doing it to impress Suzy rather than because he is capable. I’d probably make sure that people carry their own personal gear and try to make the group gear split a little more even.  I wouldn’t want Mark to be overburdened on our hard day tomorrow. It’s fine that Mark and Suzy are getting along, but I might assign tarp groups and separate them to discourage any ‘hopping.’
3.	The group as whole is suffering from sub-grouping problems.  While I don’t believe an intervention with specific FOPpers is necessary yet, I’d like to have a discussion with Peter about how to guide the group in a more positive direction.  Specifically we could try to steer the discussion topics away from exclusive vacations and more towards things that the whole group can relate to.  I would try to mix up the hiking order to make sure that everyone is getting a chance to really talk to and get to know everyone else.  I’d also like to start playing different trail games and telling riddles to see if that can get the quieter FOPpers more engaged, especially Kelly, Jack, and Renee.

July 2013: Climb up  Oahu's tallest mountain (Day hike)
2003-07: Sporadic Camping with boy scouts 

To be honest, I don't think that my outdoor experience outside of FOP is very deep. But I've always had a deep fascination with Zombie/Apocalypse films and so to me the constant question is: What the deuce would I do in that situation. Though, by no means is that my online interest in apply for FOP leadership, it does drive  my passion about learning outdoor skills  and spending time  in the backcountry. ]]></Q6.1>

 (I taught Chinese for two months to kids ranging in ages from 5 - 18. Let me say teaching a foreign language like Chinese while only speaking Chinese is easily one of the most exciting, and challenging experiences I've ever had. It forced me to be patient, careful not to go too fast, understanding, and above all else: determined to have my kids learn Chinese. ) 
2. Founder and Core Leader of "The Intersection": after school volunteer program for at risk youth - (2011-13) 
     (Volunteered every day after school for two year, led a group that held a unique activity for the kids daily. Over all, group volunteered over 4000 hours - and was selected as my towns youth volunteer of the year. In this group, I taught/led a unique project every day - that ranged from crafts (i.e. fortune makers, tie-dye shirts,) to food (gingerbread houses, pizza, etc.)  to science. We worked every day with at-risk youth, which meant that, again, patience and caring were two HUGE traits that  I think I've come away with.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[  I spent my last night as a camp counselor folding small bow-ties out of painfully thick construction paper. Also, to be clear, these bow ties were horrendous - the first five I made looked closer to being dilapidated X-wings than any envisioned origami.  The next five were no better, and the following five existed. And yet, for the next 3 hours  I kept folding. 
      I have no particular skill in paper folding, nor any keen interest in design. But, I thought they would be sweet. As I finished folding each one,  I taped onto it a small, individual rolled up message. 
      I made 44 bow-ties that night. One for every counselor I'd worked with over the previous two months. On the final night of our camp, I didn't go out. I didn't unwind by sleeping early. Instead, I volunteered to keep night watch over the kids. I thought each counselor deserved to know how much he/she meant to me - so I wrote it down and  I gave it to them. 
    
      I am not brave, strong, or particularly experienced in the backcountry. But, I am considerate of the people around me. I will not be the FOP leader that teaches the elaborate knot, or tells stories of bear-hunting in Norway. But, I will be the leader who listens, and constantly thinks about how he can make his group grow closer. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[
  On the second to last day of FOP our leaders gave us a choice: A five mile hike to a small waterfall or a three mile hike at to a nice campsite along the trail. We were a level A service group. We had not hiked with full gear for the entirety of the trip and on the last day-hike we’d been on there were significant differences in the level of difficulty individuals thought the hike had been. 
     “Let’s do the waterfall” 
     “I don’t know.., it might be a bit harder than you think.” 
     “I’m sure it won’t be that bad - we have to just go for it,” I replied. 
     “No, I really think it will be harder than you think,” added another member. 
     We continued on like this for the net 15 minutes. Me, vehemently arguing that we should push ourselves, and every other member saying that we should play it safe. Every other member but one. 
     During the midst of the entire conversation, I hadn’t noticed the member of our group who’d had the hardest time on the hike before. In fact, that member, who easily had the most at stake in the conversation, hadn’t said a single word. 
     Then I realized the conversation we were having wasn’t really about our group as a whole. It wasn’t even about our group on average. When I’d been arguing about what I fervently believed our group could do, everyone else had been arguing about what some in our group couldn’t do. 
     I love challenges. But often I overlook that a challenge for me may mean something completely different to the group that I lead. Understanding limitations is not something that is intuitive to me - and it is honestly something that will come up as a FOP leader.  I will address it though, it’s simply another.. challenge. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>He was egging me on. I know he was. He was saying words like "difficult" and "never been done before". He even mentioned that it would be a challenge. He was good. Too good.   
      Three years ago, I sat wit ha small group of high school student, concerned parents, and  a speckled number of rotarians. We - the students - were to decide which country we would live in as exchange students.  
      I was set on a spanish speaking nation. I'd studied abroad in Latin America in the past, and I spoke vaguely conversational spanish. My plan was to become a flesh and blood gringo. Then our "outbound" director spoke. 
     "We have an opportunity for one student to go to Taiwan - though the language and culture may be hard."
     There he was again, nipping at that taste of adventure.   
      In that stuffy Missouri room, I was presented with a choice. On one hand, I could be egged on to going to Taiwan. On the other, I could go to a spanish speaking nation, learn a lot about latin culture and language, and come out a different person. 
     I decided on Taiwan. 
     Now, to say the prospect of a challenge was not a part of the reason would be to deceive. However, beneath that thrown down gauntlet lay a  real question I consider in every decision I make.  Would I be proud of the decision I make in 10, 20, however number of years.  Every decision you make reflects the person you want to be. Do I want to be someone who can do something difficult? Should I continue something merely because I have experience in it. A factor, I should have considered - but didn't at the time - was what affect my decision would have on my family. Would they be able to visit in one place instead of another? Would living in a different time zone strain my relationship with them?  
    Still the question remains, will I be proud of the decision I make in 10 years? I am proud, and I hope to be proud as a leader. </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[1. My first concern - the one that I believe is most pressing - is a growing exclusion of Renee. What troubles me the most about her situation is the she - unlike Kelly and Jack - began the trip rather talkative and throughout the course of the week has changed to becoming more quiet around potential friends. Indeed, I think that it is this change which brings the largest concern - though it is not immediately clear that Lizzie and Matilda's conversation has caused her to be more quiet. 
I think that in general it is better to create good than to try to stop an evil. That is to say, in this type of situation, I think that it is better to try to include Renee more in conversation than it is to admonish Lizzie and Matilda for bonding over a common experience they've had. In particular, I would engage Renee in talking about her life and what she's interested in over dinner.  I would also talk to Peter about this to do the same. It's important that we're on the same page in terms of making certain FOPpers feel listened to. Though, it would be counterproductive to focus exclusively on her - airing out some of the things she loves provides new fodder for other FOPpers to interact with her. 

2. My second concern, lies with Kelly and her shivering. Safety first is a mantra that I've been overloaded with over my life (and over the week of FOP) and I think it is a central tenet to being a leader. In particular, I think that having a FOPper who may potentially have something physically dangerous happening is something that as a leader we need to hone in on. First, I would speak with Peter - I think all of the concerns that you have should be shared with the other leaders (So that you guys come at the same problems with the same general plan). However, with Kelly again, I think that you have to work to promote good than to stop evil. First, I would give her an extra blanket, layer, etc. - something to let her know that she is cared for, but nothing that is particularly obtrusive or calls attention to her from other FOPpers. Also, I'd try to coordinate with Peter to see if she is eating well. Food on FOP is undoubtedly not luxury food - but if a FOPper is eating significantly less than others, it definitely is something we want to look into. 

3. Finally, I think that the third largest concern is Phillip, both in how he treats others, and how Peter is interacting with him. I think that this is a concern because FOP honestly is your family for the first couple of weeks when you get back. It's important for Phillip to work to connect with other FOPpers and to recognize that this is the class that he will be a part of. I would, of course, first talk to Peter about this - reminding him that Phillip undoubtedly is coming from a different place than other FOPpers. Phillips ignoring of other campers, and attached nature to the FOP leaders, however, belays an underlying problem he may face in the first couple of weeks of school. This is something we definitely want to address. I think that night, as it is the third night, it would be important to talk candidly about some of the fears/reservations we have about going to Harvard for the first time. I also took a gap year, so I would try to address some of Phillips underlying concerns (that he is more mature, etc.) by talking about my story - I connected most with people when I let go of my feeling that I was somehow "different". In letting out our own fears, and paralleling Phillip's story with my own - I think that we can begin a bigger conversation with Phillip transitioning into life back at school. ]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[Over the past year I have gotten involved in new activities and have grown from meaningful experiences that strengthen what I can bring to FOP. Last summer, I had the opportunity to teach in an inner-city school in Harlem for the month of July, at a school in China and at one in Japan as well. In Harlem, I worked with a very motivated and bright group of middle school students in my own classroom. The school’s philosophy stressed strict discipline, which required me to alter my disposition to match the school and the students’ needs.  In China I worked with an energetic group of high school students, who were proficient in English, and in Japan I taught a much more subdued group of English learners.  In addition, I am currently a mentor with the Allston Education Portal, where I work one-on-one with various students on an assortment of projects.  These experiences, all considerably different from one another, have required me to tailor my own teaching and working strategies to the specific needs of each group.  I have learned to always come prepared, while being open to improvisation when the situation requires it.  I have gained a deeper understanding of how to interact with different people with diverse needs, and I believe these skills would be very useful for speaking with and getting to know both my foppers and fellow leader on my FOP trip. ]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2>FOP was an incredible and formative experience for me!  If I were a leader, I would ensure that my foppers have the same type of experience. I believe that my greatest strengths for leading a trip are my compassion and my ability to relate to and sympathize with others. I think these particular strengths translate into my ability to really mesh with most types of personalities.  Leaders set the tone of trips as well as the first impressions of college life, and so I would lead with energy, excitement, and, most importantly, care.  I imagine my trip as upbeat, cohesive, and formative for my foppers, which requires that everyone feels completely comfortable and safe.  This is the environment I would be determined to create.  I also believe that I am a very responsible and organized person, traits that seem essential in the backcountry. I am confident in my ability to lead first-years, to bring out leadership and enthusiasm in my foppers, and to make FOP a time of personal growth and meaningful transition.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[Besides learning how to cook food (FOP style), I think the biggest challenge I would face as a leader is finding the right balance of involvement in the social dynamic among the foppers.  Leaders face the uncertainty of when and whether to really step into the group and take control of a situation.  I am very trusting in my judgment, but I recognize that there is a delicate line between establishing oneself as a leader and meddling too much in the foppers relationships.  I think a nuanced approach is key for this.  It is critical for leaders to guide their foppers through the week in the woods, but at the same time, it is essential for the foppers to really make their own unique and memorable experiences, and most importantly, recognize that they have grown as individuals throughout the trip.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[During July I worked at an independent middle school in Harlem, New York City.  The school had an extremely strict discipline policy that included a three-strike system for behavior issues ranging from talking out of turn to picking up pencils without permission from the teacher.  Going into the summer, I hoped that I wouldn’t give a third strike to any students and be forced to kick anyone out of class.  After two weeks of teaching, however, a student in my math class began breaking some of the more minor rules.  At first, I was unsure whether or not to enforce the policy strictly. After all, the rules he was breaking seemed so insignificant and were things that students at other schools would do without thinking twice.  However, I was positive that he understood the rules well and that if I let him continue to break them, this could lead to more significant issues in the future as well as a lack of uniformity in school-wide discipline. I decided to give him his third strike and had him leave the classroom.  I didn’t want this student to be upset with me, and I didn’t want to come off as unreasonable, but I knew that it was my responsibility to ensure the rules were applied fairly.  The next day I came into class unsure about how the student would handle himself, but it was much better than I expected, and he clearly understood the policy and did not take it personally. He walked in with a smile on his face and acted almost as if it had never happened.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[There are various concerns that I would address were I the FOP leader in this scenario.  The first and most pressing concern is always the safety of the foppers.  Kelly’s shivering is a very bad sign, and could be the result of severe dehydration (or potentially hypothermia depending on the severity of the weather conditions or the result of low blood sugar).  So, before continuing to hike, we would ensure that she is okay, give her lots of water, food, and layers for warmth, and call this in if it continued or worsened in any way.  Also, in case she were worried about slowing down the group, Peter and I would instruct all of the foppers to put on layers and take similar precautions because the sun may be going down soon and, as we’ve all been sweating, the cold could become dangerous.  One of the FOP leaders would also walk with her for the rest of the day, even if her shivering were resolved.  Another safety issue that would need to be addressed is with Mark.  Even if he says he feels comfortable carrying so much weight, doing so is inherently very unsafe in FOP hiking conditions, and this weight would have to be redistributed before continuing. 

Of equal importance, I would want to speak with Peter to make sure we are on the same page and that he is doing well himself, and so that we can tackle all of these problems together. Although I understand that we need to set up our tarp quickly, I would suggest that maybe we should take our time to make sure it is done right. (This may be relevant in general too because Peter leading us down the wrong path may have been the result of rushing, though I wouldn’t bring any of this up in an accusatory way.)  In addition, I would talk to Peter about Phillip and help integrate Phillip with the rest of the foppers and ensure that we are both careful about our body language with the foppers.  Lastly, I would just want to mention to Peter that the Foppers should definitely stay away from the Gage Caves but that they also should not be wandering off that far in general. Perhaps in addition to telling the foppers not to go, we could start some games to get everyone’s attention.

Lastly, there also are some very important social concerns.  The drastic change in Renee’s disposition seems to be particularly worrisome.   To improve the situation, I would start by attempting to change the subject of Lizzie and Matilda’s conversation to something that might be more accessible for Renee and try to bring her back into the group. Whether Renee continued to be unresponsive or not, I would speak to Peter about the situation and work with him to see how we could create a more inclusive hiking atmosphere, whether through hiking games or simply more directed conversations that would also hopefully inspire Kelly and Jack to become more active members of the group.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I have a consistent positive attitude that makes it easy for me to motivate people and make the best of a less than ideal situation.  At camp, kids always say that their favorite aspect is their counselors and cabinmates.  We spend a lot of time playing games and engaging in discussions that foster a strong group dynamic because it is so central to the experience.  My experience motivating groups of campers has prepared me to help a group of FOPpers connect with each other, which was a central part of my FOP experience. My tripmates and leaders were some of my closest friends when we arrived on campus and three months later, I know I can still go to them for anything.

Many times on my gap year, things did not go as planned.  Programs were canceled, flights were rerouted, and bad weather abounded.  I tried to see each setback as an opportunity and not let things out of my control bother me.  I was flexible, which allowed me to meet a lot of interesting people and do cool things that may not have originally been part of my plan.  When I broke my leg and had to quit my job as a ski instructor, I regrouped and had fantastic experiences in Spain and Tanzania.  This ability to go with the flow would be helpful as a FOP leader: when gear gets lost or weather turns bad, the leaders’ attitude has a lot of influence on how the group responds.   
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[When I am engaged in an activity, I sometimes forget to stay attentive to the needs of others.  When I worked as a ski instructor last winter, I was so excited to share my love for the sport with my class of six kids.  Most of the time, they mirrored my enthusiasm and had an awesome time.  However, sometimes I wouldn’t notice that a member of the class was tired or cold until they mentioned it, which when dealing with six year olds is often too late.  I am working on being more perceptive and anticipating those situations, which can be the difference between a positive experience and a negative one.  On FOP, monitoring how the group feels about the pace and preempting blisters lets FOPpers focus on pushing themselves and making new friends as they prepare for college.  A good leader maximizes the experience of each person in the group by addressing these potential problems before they can interfere with the experience.  My FOP leaders did a great job of keeping track of all of us and monitoring needs we didn’t even know we had.  I admire them for that because it is a skill I am still working on.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One year at camp, I had a camper who cheered competitively at home.  She wanted to teach her cabinmates, so a group of girls were practicing cartwheels outside.  The girl then suggested that she could teach them a lift she had learned.  I was thrilled to see the girls making new friends, but I didn't feel comfortable supervising stunting.  This incident occurred toward the beginning of the session, at which time I wanted to make a good impression on the girls that would be living with me for the month.  I desperately wanted them to be friends and have fun.  Despite the soft ground and assurances from the camper whose idea it was that they wouldn't lift her too high, I vetoed the activity and said I would love for her to teach them a cheer but there could be no stunting because we didn't have someone trained to supervise.  I tried to explain my reasoning (safety) and divert the activity by suggesting that they could practice the camp cheer they were learning and keeping my tone upbeat and positive. The camper was upset and didn't want to speak to me that day, which I took personally.  I talked it over with a supervisor and we determined that the girl would come around (she did).  If I had it to do over again, I would have considered how that girl's disappointment would affect the group (it did, negatively) and made more of an active effort to organize an alternative activity.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[One of my concerns is that the FOPpers maybe aren't as aware as they could be of their differences in background and experience.  This is evident in how the Mathilda, Lizzie, and Phillip’s stories seem to be monopolizing conversation instead of starting dialogue.  One of the best things about FOP is meeting people who are truly a cross section of the Harvard student body, so I would like to see the group take advantage of that aspect and get to know each other.  They have an opportunity to form genuine friendships by being open to people unlike themselves. I hope if they learn more about each other, they will feel more comfortable sharing stories and experiences and become closer.  To accomplish this, I might do an activity like 3-minute biographies after dinner, during which each person would be free to share their story and what makes them who they are. 

I am also concerned about cliques.  In particular, I want to integrate the shy FOPpers, Kelly and Jack.  I would like to see them come out of their shells.  Also, I would like to see Daniel and Renee making friends.  By connecting these FOPpers with others the group I would hope that the cliqueiness that is emerging would diminish.  Hiking together on the trail is a great opportunity for me as a leader to foster a group dynamic because we are all together and walking single file.  To help those FOPers reach out and mix everyone up, I would vary the line order.  Maybe one morning we would walk birthday order, another day alphabetically, and so on.   We could also play a game on the trail, like Contact, that would help everyone to feel included.

My final concern would be presenting a united front with my co-leader, Peter.  If we had been communicating more effectively, we may not have led our FOPpers down the wrong trail.  Also, having two sets of eyes scouting for potential issues would improve our ability to solve problems before they occur.  For example, we can make sure Kelly is warm enough and monitor the morning gear distribution to ensure that Mark doesn’t overburden himself.  Since we can’t both be everywhere at once, sharing our observations will help us to be more vigilant.  Having two perspectives will paint a fuller picture of how our FOPpers are doing and ultimately be better for the group. To accomplish this, we can have more frequent check-ins and share the responsibility for problem solving.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think one of my greatest strengths would be my energetic optimism. It’s incredibly important to show enthusiasm for the task at hand when going through a challenge and I think could lead well in this manner and instill similar traits in my FOPpers.  I also believe that I can strike a good balance between realistic advice and being super positive, which is important when helping freshman acclimate to Harvard. We need to give them advice they can use in an effective manner that is realistic but positively so. Another strong attribute of mine is being able to truly connect with the people around me. This sense of connecting is what I believe makes a relationship valuable, and it would be no different for the relationship between a FOPper and his/her leader. Additionally, I am very perceptive of other people’s feelings and am aware of group dynamics.  ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My greatest challenge would be becoming confident enough in my own skills and things I’ve learned as a freshman at Harvard to advise freshmen on some of the more difficult questions they ask. I think that it is incredibly important to be honest, but I would need to prepare myself on how to deliver my honest responses, knowing what I would say as a person compared with as a leader and the best way to express that. Another challenge is the technical side of leading the group through the wilderness.  Building enough confidence to not just know various necessary skills but also have them become second nature will be a challenge.  ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[A difficult decision I had to make was when I discovered that a close friend was inflicting pain on herself and cutting her arm as a coping mechanism.  She confided this fact in me and while I was happy she could open up to me, I realized that there was only a certain amount of support and help I could provide as a friend/peer.  I had to decide whether or not it was my place to contact someone more fit to help such as a counselor at school or to tell her sister or other family members. Beyond listening to her troubles and trying to be there for her as a friend, I didn’t feel I could be there the same way a professional adult counselor could be. Factors to consider were if this information was mine to tell someone else, if intervention from an adult would cause more angst and stress for her, and how this decision would impact my relationship with my friend. In the end, I told her directly that I thought she needed to see a counselor or talk to her family about her coping issues. I offered my assistance telling those people, but also said that I would need to contact someone if she did not herself for her own wellbeing. This allowed me to give her help without her being unprepared or not in control of the process herself. In the end, she told her family and they were able to get her help.  
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The first concern that is pressing to me would be about the group dynamics as a whole. I think certain divides are beginning to form within the group and tackling those would be my priority. It’s unavoidable that people will prefer and develop certain relationships more than others, but I feel that it is the leaders’ job to ensure no one is feeling left out or uncomfortable on the trip and that everyone gets a chance to learn about the other FOPpers and also tell their own story. I would meet with Peter and talk to him about subtly adjusting our plan so as to make the environment more conducive for the FOPpers to talk to all of the rest of the group members. This would include mixing up the lines based on various criteria, playing games with the group as a whole during breaks, and even going in and starting conversations that everyone could talk about regardless of background or upbringing. Individual conversations can be expanded to the FOPper in front or behind and I would make sure Phillip and I were acutely aware of the conversations being had and see if we could ever include one or two more people. Additionally, I would encourage Phillip to try and connect Peter with other FOPpers. It’s easy for gap year students to separate themselves from those straight out of high school, but it would be much more beneficial for the whole group for Peter to maintain an open mind about those he’s FOPping with and to perhaps share his experiences/worldly wisdom with others.  Next, I would address my concern with Kelly.  I feel as though there might be some sort of self-worth issues indicated by the actions described above and it would be very important to reach out and say that it’s okay to have problems or to be feeling a certain way at any point (i.e. cold, hungry, etc.), but that it would be more beneficial to tell the leaders about it so that we may help her. Additionally, I would address the entire group and spread that message along, hoping to quell any reluctance to speak up about one’s own wellbeing. The issue with Renee, Lizzie, and Matilda is a little trickier but extremely important to tackle. I would start by talking to Renee myself and getting to know a little bit more about her and her interests. Then I’d proceed to draw other FOPpers into our conversation and try to find some commonalities between Renee and the other FOPpers. Perhaps I’d choose topics that are not divisive, like television or movies and even focus on getting Kelly and Jack involved. I think though it’s important to show Renee that even if she may not have the same upbringing as Lizzie and Matilda, she still has a wealth of experiences of her own that are valuable and no less important than the other girls’.  ]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[-Annual family ski trips for 1-2 weeks to various places in Colorado (Vail, Telluride, Aspen), Maine (Sugarloaf), Vermont (Stowe), Canada (Whistler, Mont Tremblant), Switzerland (Zermatt), and France (Val d’Isère).  I sometimes ski with and help teach my little sister, who is 10 years younger than me.  At night I help cook dinner.
-Family sailing trips for 1-2 weeks through various places in New England (Long Island Sound, Narragansett Bay, Buzzards Bay, the Maine coast) and the Caribbean (the Grenadines, the Exumas, the Abacos), once or twice every year since I was very young.  I help my dad do various things on the boat, so I’ve learned a lot about sailing from these trips.
-2 overnight Girl Scout camping trips in New England when I was in elementary school (4th and 5th grade).  I learned how to set up a tent and build a fire.
-Overnight camping trip this past August with a few of my friends on a little uninhabited island in North Carolina.  I gathered firewood and helped set up the tents.  
-FOP backpacking trip (level C) this past August to the White Mountains in New Hampshire.  I often helped to purify water and set up tarps and bear bags.  I learned a lot about living in and taking care of the wilderness.
]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2>-I volunteered as an online writing coach for the Harvard Writing and Public Service Initiative this past November.  I gave two Boston Latin Academy students feedback on drafts of their college essays.
-I was a senior editor for my high school literary magazine during my junior and senior years.  We made the ultimate decisions about which pieces to publish and how to edit them.  We also made decisions about the layout of the magazine.

		<Q7.2>One of my greatest strengths in leading a group of first-year students will be my ability to connect to and find common ground with anyone.  No matter how diverse the group is, discovering what we have in common will allow us to feel a sense of group unity.  Another strength I have is the ability to pick up on how people are feeling or what they are thinking, even if they are too shy or polite say it out loud.  This will allow me to know when the group needs a morale boost or we need to take breaks for water or food, or change routes.  Another strength is how open and honest I tend to be about my own feelings and thoughts.  Maintaining open communication in the group is important, and if I can be honest about how I am feeling, it will encourage others to be open as well.  I also have an ability to laugh at myself and keep things light, which I think will make me approachable and non-intimidating as a leader.  This is important because I will want my FOPpers to feel comfortable asking me anything, whether they need help in the wilderness or advice about their first year at Harvard.  A sense of humor is also important because it keeps people positive, even if the trail is difficult or the weather is bad.  I also tend to be a slower, more cautious hiker, which will help me be a good leader for inexperienced FOPpers.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>One of my greatest challenges in leading a group of first-year students will be maintaining a constant positive attitude in order to keep morale high and make sure everyone is having fun.  I am a generally positive person, but as a FOP leader I will have to be constantly upbeat and positive for the whole time, even if I get tired, and that might be challenging.  I think FOP leaders also always have to put the interests of their FOPpers before their own, and it might be challenging for me to learn to do that.  I might have to be the last person to eat, the last person to go to sleep, and the first person to wake up every day.  I might have to take on extra group gear or food.  I might have to give away some of my water if any of my FOPpers are running low.  I will have to learn to be completely selfless in order to make sure everyone has a safe and fun time.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[In my junior year of high school, I got a C+ on an English essay.  But when we got our progress reports that quarter, I discovered that my teacher had accidentally written in a B+ for that assignment, significantly boosting my grade for the course.  I had to decide whether to accept the higher grade as a lucky accident or point out the mistake to my teacher.  As a junior planning on applying to Harvard, I wanted to maintain a high GPA.  I also told myself that I had not technically done anything wrong—it was my teacher who had made the mistake on the progress report.  I also thought about how difficult it would be for me to bring my grade up again in the course if I took the C+.  My own pride was another factor: I had always done very well in English, and I hated the idea of possibly getting less than an A in the course.  In the end, though, I pointed out the mistake to my teacher and took the C+, and I am very happy with that decision.  I did not want to take the higher grade and have to live with the knowledge that I only did well in the course because of luck and dishonesty.  My integrity was more important to me than my GPA.  I worked hard for the rest of the semester, and got an A- in the course.  I’m proud of that A-, because I earned it honestly.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern is that the day has been longer than expected and everyone must be tired and sore, even though almost everyone has said what a positive time they’re having.  It is likely that most people are feeling tired, but don’t want to complain because they don’t want to seem weak or pessimistic.  This is a concern for me because I know tomorrow’s hike is going to be challenging, and I don’t want everyone to be burned out already.  To make sure everyone is well-rested for tomorrow, I will try to get dinner ready as early as possible and have everything cleaned up and put away quickly so we can go to sleep early.  But I will make sure to stress to the FOPpers tonight how impressed I am by their enthusiasm and energy.  Tomorrow I will suggest oatmeal for breakfast rather than cereal so everyone starts their day with something substantial.
My second concern is that the FOPpers are letting differences in their backgrounds keep them from connecting with each other.  Renee feels left out because Lizzie and Matilda have had similar upbringings and she feels like she can’t keep up with them anymore.  Phillip is letting his gap year give him a sense of superiority over the other FOPpers, which is keeping him from making friends—especially with Daniel.  This is a concern for me because it is interfering with group unity by making certain people feel isolated.  To address this problem, I will start conversations that everyone can participate in regardless of their past experiences.  I will ask questions like “What is everyone thinking of concentrating in?” or “What extracurricular activities are you planning on doing?” to try to get them to connect with each other by talking about their interests rather than their backgrounds.  I will also assign group tasks like finding good bear bag trees or setting up tarps, in order to get them to bond as a larger group.
My third concern is Kelly, who could be dealing with an eating disorder.  The clues are subtle, but I know that when you exercise and burn calories all day you need to eat more than you usually would, so it is unlikely that she is really getting full as quickly as she says she is.  She is also the only person who shivers during breaks, which could be a sign of malnutrition.  This is a concern for me because as a FOP leader I need to make sure everyone stays safe and healthy, and part of staying healthy is eating enough.  I can’t force her to eat, and it is not completely clear that she does have a disorder, but I can watch her to make sure her situation doesn’t get worse.  For now, she seems okay.  If she starts fainting on the trail, I might have to find an excuse to get her away from the group and talk to her seriously about it.  But for now, I will just watch her closely.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[-I am very comfortable in the outdoors. My entire family camps, hikes, bikes and has always vacationed in places where these activities were a major part of the experience. My grandparents had a house in Vermont and throughout my childhood we would spend time there hiking and enjoying the wilderness. 
I attended a summer camp in New Hampshire all my life with a focus on wilderness activities:

-Summers 2005-2009: At camp, I did a lot of hiking, backpacking, canoe trips, caving expeditions, etc. I went on multiple hiking trips each summer that varied in length from day hikes to 3-day trips to weeklong expeditions. 

-Summer 2010: During my last summer at the summer camp, I went on an 8 day canoe trip on the Allagash river in Maine. It was one of the most incredibly beautiful and challenging experiences I have ever had. (We saw dozens of moose everyday. It was that kind of awesome.) 

-Every summer my family goes to our favorite spot in northern Vermont (on Lake Morey) for summer vacation and we do a lot of hiking/biking/kayaking!

-Summer 2011/Summer 2012: Planned two 4-day hiking trips in Vermont with a few of my best buds from High School. They were my first experiences in the wilderness without an adult figure. 
]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[-Summer 2010: along with the aforementioned Allagash canoe trip, I was also among the few senior campers who were tasked with leading the youngest campers on hiking trips throughout the summer. 

-2010-2011: Tutor/Teaching Assistant for Middle School Students in Latin and English. 

-2011-2013: I volunteered at Eagle Academy for Young Men, a charter school in Brooklyn, New York. I taught music lessons to kids of various ages, and provided organizational support as well in the administrative office. 

-2011-2012: Member of my High School’s Peer Tutor Program. I tutored younger high school students in a variety of subjects. 

-2012-2013: Leader in High School’s Peer Leadership Program. It was my greatest time commitment/responsibility of my senior year. I met with my fellow Leaders and advisors five times a week, while meeting with my group of freshmen weekly. 

-2012-2013: Head of my High School’s Democrat Club, Performing Arts Committee (PAC), and Ski Club. All three had many and diverse organizational responsibilities: planning campaigning outings for Dems, bi-weekly student-run concerts for PAC, and organizing regular overnight ski trips for the Ski Club. 

-2012-2013: Managing editor of my school newspaper. It also had a significant amount of organizational responsibility.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think my primary strengths as a leader are my ability to engage with a diverse group of people and my extensive leadership experience. I have a very outgoing personality, and always consider myself a positive influence in a group. I am someone who can get along with and relate to all different kinds of people. I had a very diverse high school experience; diverse in the sense that I took part in a host of different activities and therefore was involved with many different communities, from Afro-punk bands to Model UN teams. I have kept this diversity of experience in my time at Harvard thus far. I love to engage lots of different kinds of people, and am never satisfied with staying in “my comfort zone.” This ability to engage with and relate to so many different people is essential to any consensus building leadership techniques. It is what I consider to be my greatest strength, and one that I would bring to my role as FOP leader. 

A second asset is my past leadership experience. As heads of various clubs at my high school, I had responsibilities that would certainly translate well to the world of FOP: organizing trips and all the detailed follow up, maintaining strong group dynamics, and being a balanced leader, without being bossy and heavy-handed. More important than my experience as a club head, however, was my experience as a Peer Leader. Peer Leadership is very similar to FOP in many ways, minus the hiking trip. I had a co-leader, and we were responsible for leading a group of 15 freshmen throughout the entire year. It was a transformational experience that helped me discover a lot of things about myself in many ways, but especially as a leader, while also helping freshmen in a transitional period. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[One of the greatest challenges of leading a group of similarly aged individuals is striking a balance between one’s role as their leader and the desire to be their friend as well. There’s no clear answer as to what is the correct balance. An effective leader has both the trust of the group that comes with friendship and the respect that comes with leadership. If one tries too hard to be a friend to the other group members, then he has lost some of his ability to lead them. A distanced, detached leader, on the other hand, will lose some of his ability to lead as well. As a peer leader, I often struggled with this balance. I loved my peer leadees, and wanted to be their friend, but also had to maintain a certain amount of distance that allowed me to lead and guide them effectively. By the end of the year, I began to find that balance. 

A second challenge in leading a group is maintaining a positive group dynamic. At times, overnight trips can hit low points, where everyone is tired, hungry, and dirty, (possibly wet from a rainstorm) and the real task of the FOP leaders is to maintain that positive attitude amongst the group members at those times when the group is not at their most excited about the FOP experience. 
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One particularly difficult experience in my high school career was becoming aware of damning information about certain individuals in the high school. After much deliberation and conversation with various adults in my life in and outside of school, I addressed the situation with what I believe was a delicate and honest balance. I was able to maintain my own moral standards without causing unnecessary damage to others. The dilemma for me was that if the information had been released, it could have also had serious effects on others who were not involved at all. I found the balance between making sure the primary individual responsible for the wrongdoing understood what he had done while also maintaining the well being of others. This decision was exceedingly difficult, because part of me wanted the sense of justice that would have been achieved easily by giving the information to an adult at my school, but the other part of me knew that revealing the information would have affected many other people who had nothing to do with the wrongdoing. Instead of just satisfying a personal need for justice and closure, I dealt with the information and knowledge in a way that didn’t harm anyone else, but also made clear to the individuals that their actions were deplorable. I learned a lot about myself from this experience, and also gained an understanding of how to be patient and thoughtful when dealing with issues that aren’t black and white. There wasn’t a clear wrong and right in this situation, and thus, I was forced to find the right action to take in a situation that was very much in a shade of grey.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The first order of business is dealing with Kelly. The social dynamics and concerns of the group are definitely important, but dealing with any potential physical problems is a priority. Kelly’s shivering during the day of hiking is not a good sign at all. Kelly is very quiet and shy, so she may very well be hiding her actual level of sickness in an attempt to not disrupt the whole trip. As FOP leader, I have to take it out of Kelly’s hands, and even though she says she is fine, I have to make sure that she doesn’t get fully sick. She could be getting a common cold or even the flu. Not only could she herself be getting sick, but she could also be putting the whole group at risk. Everyone is constantly near each other, and the illness, whatever it may be, is likely to be passed to other FOPpers. Instead of just ignoring it until it gets worse, I would have to nip it in the bud as soon as possible. Make sure she’s wearing lots of layers, eating enough food, etc. Don’t make Kelly draw attention to herself. Take all the responsibility for holding up the group, and remain extra cautious with her health. I would then try to approach Kelly away from the group to try and figure out what was really going on with her.

The second order of business is dealing with Lizzie, Matilda, and Renee. Although Lizzie and Matilda aren’t being intentionally malicious, and are not intentionally trying to exclude Renee, their actions have consequences of which they are not necessarily aware. On the surface, this problem doesn’t seem like a huge deal; Lizzie and Matilda are just talking about their upbringings, something they are totally within their right to be doing. However, the opposite is true: This issue is a huge one, because one of FOP’s primary goals is to be inclusive, and a backpacking trip is the perfect setting for this kind of inclusivity. The wilderness is, in a lot of ways, the great equalizer. The school you went to, how wealthy your parents are, etc. are irrelevant for the most part. However, Renee is being excluded and alienated by Lizzie and Matilda’s talk of their privileged upbringings. It is my role as the FOP leader to address it, but all the while making sure I don’t make Lizzie, Matilda, and Renee uncomfortable. I would refocus the group on what we brought them out here to do. There are a few different strategies I could use to try and do this. I could use myself as a conversation-director of sorts, and ensure that Renee is included. I could talk to the group as a whole about the goals of our trip to help everyone remember what we established at the beginning with the hand-tracing  “goals for the trip” activity. Either way, I need to use tact and subtlety to nip this exclusivity in the bud, but without calling out Lizzie and Matilda directly. 

The third order of business is dealing with Philip and Peter. While Daniel has not had his feelings hurt by Phillip yet, the situation is set up for it to happen. In addition, Phillip is clearly wearing down Peter’s patience, and could potentially compromise his role as FOP leader if he lashes out in any way or an “eye rolling” is caught by Phillip or the other FOPpers. There are a few steps that could be taken. First, I would talk to Peter about Phillip directly, and ask that he be more patient with Phillip. Second, try to make sure that Phillip and Peter are divided (mix up the line order or something to that effect). I would also let Peter know what I think is going on between Phillip and Daniel And if Daniel’s infatuation with Phillip continues, I could intervene by engaging both of them in a conversation about something other than Phillip’s stories so Phillip is forced to acknowledge Daniel, and the conversation is moved away from Phillip’s differences (his age and perceived “maturity”) and onto their common worries and expectations for freshman year. Those are the immediate actions that could be taken, and then further, more direct, action might be necessary depending on how the situation develops from there.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[From a young age to now: Day hikes to Table Rock and local trails in the Upstate of South Carolina and in North Carolina
	When I was younger, I would tag along with the family and make sure my dad’s shoulders stayed sore because I was carried up many trails. This was my first introduction to outdoor fun, trail signs, and wearing the proper shoes. When I’ve recently gone with my friends, I’ve made sure that we know where we are going and hike in daylight, have enough water, a nice array of snacks, and a first aid kit.

July 2013- Day kayaking trip in Tennessee
	My friends and I kayaked through fairly easy water. I helped pack the food for lunch and made sure we had enough water to drink. It was a very casual paddle, but my friend flipped her kayak. I realized it was vital to go over how to kayak safely and how to recover after mishandling the kayak. Being familiar with safety protocols could be applied to any activity I am participating in. 

January 2011- Skiing in Utah
	When I went to Utah, I had skied several times and taken lessons, so I was able to relax and enjoy my time. My brother and I used a trail map to find different peaks to ski down while making sure we stayed on the groomed slopes. I quickly learned that it was important to be comfortable reading maps and using them as guidance. Utah was beautiful, and I had the desire to continue exploring the outdoors.

April 2013- Snow Boarding and Snowmobiling in Colorado
	For snowboarding, my friend and I took lessons so my main role was to follow directions. For snowmobiling, we had to pay close attention to directions we were given before beginning our excursion. I had to remind myself that I had to be patient with my friend’s and my development. We had to help each other throughout the learning process. In both situations, I had to continuously be aware of my surrounding, as it was easy to get stuck in the snow or move in a way, which could cause injury to others or myself. Snow boarding and snowmobiling became more rewarding and enjoyable as we took the time to learn the skills.

August 2013- FOP Switch/Canoe C Trip
	FOP had the largest influence on my interest in the outdoors. At the beginning of the trip, we were less proactive in helping Mike and Toria: as the trip progressed we would begin setting up camp without them having to tell us exactly what to do. We helped cook, put up the tarp, set up the bear bags, separate the group gear into individual piles, help distribute meals, etc. It was important to not only listen as the leaders gave instructions but also learn what we needed to do by actually doing it. I also learned that it is important to be able to work as a group to accomplish tasks. It’s more difficult and less efficient to try to accomplish tasks individually. By keeping the above in mind, our FOP trip could only benefit. The friendship we were able to develop in the backcountry and carry to the front country is one reason I want to gain familiarity with the outdoors. 


I have walked through REI thinking it would take a lifetime of experience to understand the purpose of all the outdoor gear. Although I love the idea of going on outdoor adventures, I never thought it was “my thing.” And quite frankly, I have an irrational fear of snakes. That all changed when I went on FOP. I realized snakes were a small concern and being prepared for a rewarding outdoor experience does not take a lifetime of training. FOP showed me that I could take more time to see beautiful things in the backcountry and front country. Often times on FOP, I’d look up and take a deep breath: taking notice on the trails reminded me that I often overlook details. There are so many things happening aside from my everyday life, and the outdoors reminds me to slow down and pay attention. Being present is my only option in the backcountry, but I hope to take what I learn in the backcountry and apply to the front country- I want to be present whether I’m walking to a campsite or walking to a class. There are friendships to invest in, people to listen to, and places to see in the backcountry and the front country. Becoming a FOP leader will allow me to continue learning the value of being present and investing in others, while also allowing me to provide others experiences that I have found so rewarding.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[         When thinking about the potential I have as a FOP leader, the strength that comes to mind is being able to connect with FOPpers and my co-leader(s). I love being around people, so it will be easy for me to make conversation and get to know my FOPpers. In conversation, I am usually completely honest and open. I will talk about things I have enjoyed and things I have struggled with.  Honesty and openness are the foundation to group connections, and if I am able to have open dialogue, I think that will encourage my FOPpers to do the same. Honest exchange will in turn help my FOPpers to care for and gain a deeper respect for the group and others, which will hopefully extend beyond the week we have in the outdoors.
	Another strength I will bring to leading FOP is my sense of humor, which usually comes in the form of corny jokes. My humor helps me take myself less seriously, which can make me more approachable. FOPpers can see me as someone who encourages open conversation but can also take the time to laugh and be lighthearted. I often crack jokes about seemingly uncomfortable situations, like pooping in the woods. I hope my sense of humor will help people enjoy the parts of FOP that can seem awkward or difficult.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[	I have a tendency to be overly concerned about situations that I have little control over. It stems from my desire to make sure that everything is working how I expect it to work. In the context of FOP, I will worry about my FOPpers and co-leader. I will worry whether they are enjoying themselves, well fed, and getting along with the group. My worrying could cause me to act unnaturally when approaching FOPpers. I could try to force group cohesion rather than letting it happen naturally or single someone out by asking them if they have eaten enough. If I am nervous about something, it could be harder for me to be present in the moment on FOP, which could hinder my ability to pay attention to the entire FOP group and my co-leader(s).
	It is also difficult for me to stay calm if something is going wrong. A challenge will be not over over-expressing my emotions in a worrisome situation, in order to make sure my FOPpers, co-leader(s), and I are safe and doing what we are supposed to do. When I am nervous or uneasy, it is also very noticeable to the people around me. If I have trouble staying calm this could cause my FOPpers and co-leader(s) to worry unnecessarily, and I will not be able to help my co-leader(s) lead our FOPpers to the best of our ability. FOP would be an opportunity to address these challenges and learn how to cope with them more effectively in the backcountry and front country.

		<Q7.4><![CDATA[          When I returned to play soccer after ACL repair, the Harvard Varsity soccer coach told me that his recruiting spots were filled, but he encouraged me to tryout for the Varsity team if I got into Harvard. I was frustrated and disheartened, but I kept training. A few months passed, and I got into Harvard and had to decide whether I was going to tryout for the Varsity soccer team. All of my club soccer teammates were playing college soccer, and I felt like that’s what I was supposed to do. I began asking myself whether I wanted to play college soccer because it was expected or because I truly had a desire to continue developing as a player. I began to realize that, the idea of Varsity soccer was separate from my image of college, so I began seriously considering whether Varsity soccer was necessary in order for me to gain what I wanted from my four years. After closing out a phenomenal last season with my club team, I wanted to begin investing time and energy into different experiences. I realized I didn’t have to have a plan revolving around soccer. If I wanted to tryout for Varsity soccer later on, I had that option, and there was also the option of playing Harvard club soccer. After talking to my brother, mentors, and teammates, I realized it was my choice to make. Following a tearful conversation with my club soccer coach of six years, I made the decision to not pursue Varsity soccer at Harvard. Although I’m enjoying playing Harvard club soccer now, I wish I had considered that in a less competitive setting it would be difficult to mimic the adrenaline rush that comes from playing in a big game. I also didn’t consider that the bonds formed when a team competitively works for a common goal would be more difficult to come by in a new environment. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[          Lizzie and Matilda have isolated Renee with their conversations about upbringing. Renee, coming from a small town, has stopped conversing with Lizzie and Matilda because she might feel like she cannot relate to a privileged upbringing and has little to contribute to the conversation. These feelings could translate into her being uncomfortable talking about her experiences on the trip. As she progresses through her freshman year, she might continue to feel that her experiences aren’t as interesting as her classmates’ experiences. I would become involved in the conversation and ask Renee about what she did during her summer- making sure I also have Lizzie and Matilda’s attention.  Renee will have unique stories to share coming from a small town, and her experiences are just as valuable as those of Lizzie and Matilda. I would also let Peter know about the dynamic between Lizzie, Matilda, and Renee, so he could be aware of the situation, and we could discuss what ways we can both help to resolve the problem.
	My second concern comes from Peter’s reaction to Phillip. Because Peter is a leader on the trip, the FOPpers look up to him. If others noticed Peter’s eye roll, they might feel like Peter doesn’t care about what they have to say. The eye roll is also a sign that Peter is annoyed and not in the best mood. It is important to address Peter’s feelings, so he can also enjoy the trip, work to build relationships with Phillip and the other FOPpers, and co-lead effectively. I would talk to Peter because supporting one another is vital to effective leadership. We can talk about the Phillip situation and ways to resolve it- such as having me hike near Phillip and initiate conversation with Phillip and the other FOPpers. Peter can hike near different FOPpers to learn more about them, and so he can take a break from Phillip. I would also bring up the eye rolling issue and why it is important for us, as leaders, to not react impulsively but rather talk to each other about it so we can lead well and maintain an inviting atmosphere for our FOPpers. 
	Because Kelly is quieter on the trip and doesn’t interact much with the other FOPpers, she probably doesn’t want to draw attention to herself. Kelly also gives away her dessert and does nice things for others, which makes me think she cares that there’s a positive group atmosphere and everyone is happy. This could cause her to avoid concerning others with her well-being. But her shivering could be a sign of hypothermia, and health of the FOPpers is a priority. Kelly could be cold because her clothes are wet from the thunderstorm or from lack of layering. If she tells me she’s fine in front of the group, I would ask her to help me with a task so I could talk to her one on one. I would first explain why I am worried about her shivering and why it’s important to resolve this problem. I would then ask her specific questions about how she is feeling, how she’s been eating and sleeping, and what layers she is wearing and has in her backpack. If she feels isolated by being the only one having to change her layers, I would offer to also change my own clothes. If necessary, I would abide by the proper hypothermia protocol. I would make sure Peter is aware of Kelly’s condition, so he could also keep an eye out on her.

		<Q7.2>     I take pride in the fact that I do not take myself too seriously. I feel that this aspect of my personality allows me to connect with a variety of people on a daily basis and makes me approachable. In a situation in which I am surrounded by a group of first-year students, creating a comfortable environment for them is key and I feel that I have an easy time doing that. I also sing a lot, which I find to be helpful in uncomfortable situations because I cannot carry a tune very well yet I still try and it often warrants a couple of chuckles. I also feel very accomplished when I can make someone else laugh because I know for that one moment in time they are happy.
	Adding to that, I really enjoy when people look to me for guidance, which I feel is a strength among a group of students who are about to embark on a new chapter in their lives. I have the ability to command the attention of a group and I am the type of person who makes decisions in a crowd where everyone is standing around waiting for someone else to decide for them. In my group of friends I am the one that people consider level-headed and always thinks calmly. This is a valuable skill to possess if anything were to go wrong out in the wilderness with a group of first year students.  
</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>     One of my greatest challenges leading a group of first-year students would be letting my independence getting in the way of allowing the students to learn in an outdoor environment. I could see myself trying to take on all the tasks such as setting up camp and making dinner instead of leaning on the students to aid in the efforts. But knowing the way that FOP goes about divvying up responsibilities, I think it would be almost impossible for me to do everything on my own, which is a very good thing. I need to become the type of person that does not mind leaning on others for help in a situation where it is necessary. 
	Also, knowing my tendencies very well, as a leader I would be challenged to open up and share things with the students that I normally would not share on a daily basis. I was surprised on my FOP trip that I was able to be so honest with my group and I hope as a leader I can continue that honesty in the outdoor environment. I am accustomed to keeping things to myself and not sharing my feelings very often, and I am working on opening up to people. As a leader it will be my responsibility to create a safe environment where students feel comfortable sharing with a group of strangers, so I believe that with that idea in mind I will be able to open up more easily that under normal circumstances. 
</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[     At first, I hated the idea of going to Harvard. I was extremely happy when I opened the email that contained my acceptance, but I quickly questioned what people would think of me if I chose Harvard. 
	During the weeks the led up to decision day (D Day in my eyes), I wrestled with my options. I constantly thought about what image I would be portraying by going to Harvard and if I was just falling into the cliché roll by the smart girl in school. What really helped me make the decision was the aid of one of my best friends. He made me realize that I was not making the decision for all those other people, but instead it was about where I was going to spend the next four years of my life and where I would feel comfortable. I owe a lot to my friend and I would not have been able to get through that time without him. 
	Looking back on it, I wish I would not have been as concerned about what other people would think of my decision. My friend made me realize that I had worked so hard in high school so that I could make opportunities available for myself in the future. If I had considered that point of view from the beginning, I feel like my decision would have been a lot simpler.  
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[     My biggest concern about the trip is the cliques that appear to be forming within the group of FOPpers. It is good to establish friendships on the trip, but becoming too close to another FOPper can make other members of the group feel excluded, which ruins their experience. In this case there seem to be a lot of people that are paired up into groups, so my first action would be to switch up the walking order the next day for the five mile hike in order to allow the students to get to know everyone on the trip. Everyone in the group can connect purely because they are all first-year students at Harvard, and hopefully that connection can harbor some deeper relationships for the students that do not know each other very well thus far. Five miles gives a lot of time for the students to talk about their lives and find commonalities with each other. 
	Another concern for me is Renee’s experience on the trip. This is a concern for me because I do not want students to go into the semester with the wrong idea of what Harvard is really like. It is important to me that students know Harvard does not fall into all of the stereotypes that surround the school because having misconceptions about this great place will dampen their experience here. Coming from a family that did not go on many organized trips during my childhood, I understand how Renee would be feeling left out when the other girls talk about their past vacations to exotic places. I would reassure her that Harvard is full of a mix of people that come from all different backgrounds and that there are no two backgrounds that are exactly alike. I would also encourage her to be proud of where she came from because her experience coming to Harvard and getting accustomed to college life will be unlike anyone else’s.  I would tell her that she needs to be proud of where she came from and to not constantly compare herself to other students once she arrives on campus because that will do her no good. 
	Third, I would confront Daniel about his behavior on the trip. It seems that he is trying to put on a façade to try and get his fellow FOPpers, Phillip especially, to like him. He needs to be told that he does not have to try excessively hard to get people to like him; all he has to do is be himself because I am sure he has something very special about him to have been accepted to Harvard. Confidence is a key thing to have throughout college, and I want to instill that in Daniel’s mind because in order to go forward into the future, he will need to have confidence in himself. If I am the person who can teach him that attribute, I will be extremely happy because I know I have taught him a valuable skill.

It was a lot of work but also so much fun and I gained very important planning skills that I never before had. On a sort of unrelated note, I feel like as a sophomore, I know much more about Harvard than last year when I was filling out this application. I've seen more people struggle with the transition into college and now more fully understand the goal of FOP to help people assimilate into a new environment. </Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Coming into a new environment of any sort is difficult even for the most social and outgoing people, especially when that environment is a whole new home, perhaps very far from your own. Being someone who initially got swept up in the bustle of freshman year and could pop home in fifteen minutes on the train, I didn't initially realize the various and sometimes quite difficult transitions that people go through. I now see that this is a key aspect of the start of college and feel that as a FOP leader, I would be able to assist people in this transition. There are of course many ways to do so, but specifically my comfortableness with getting to know people and general enthusiasm are traits that could be helpful. Creating a new home with new people in it requires a lot of careful effort right at the beginning, as relationships first form and first impressions are made. I can see myself helping to create these new connections, especially outside in a an environment in which I feel very comfortable, as a leader but also as a friend who will talk to anyone about anything. I also think that the outdoors are really a beautiful place where I can always find peace and escape and I can’t imagine a better place to share an experience with a new group of students. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[If I am teaching someone how to do something or am watching someone do something and they are struggling to complete their task, I will jump in and try to help them. But often what I realize I am doing is actually just taking whatever they are doing and completing in for them, instead of trying to assist them or explain it in a different way so that they understand. I think I do this mainly because I just get frustrated and feel like the quickest way to solve the problem is to do it myself, which is of course not always the case. And even if it is, I need to get better at realizing that teaching someone a skill will forever benefit them and far outweigh the benefit of getting it quickly done myself. It could be something very simple, like tying a bowline. I can't remember how many times in my life I’ve needed to ask someone to remind me how to tie a bowline. And now if I saw someone struggling to tie one, I would offer to help them but I can see my patience catching up to me and telling them I could just do it for them. I definitely feel like there would be other challenges but this one is important to me just because it’s internal and would be something I would need to work on personally.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I had a great friend at the beginning of freshman year that started to slowly drift away from our friend group towards the end of first semester. I still saw her quite often but she became very disconnected from our other friends, so of course when the time to block rolled around, inevitable issues arose. It pretty much came down to several members of my potential blocking group coming up to me and saying they didn’t want to live with said friend who had drifted away. Although I still felt quite close to her, I couldn’t see myself leaving the rest of my friends so we decided to form a blocking group without her. The difficult decision was how to tell her this. I know so many people who did what I call the group attack, where they all sit down with someone and tell them they don't want them in their blocking group. I always thought this was too much so we went one by one to talk to her. I went first and conveyed clearly what I wanted and she seemed to understand. But another member of the group did not convey her feelings in the nicest of ways and ended up pretty much creating a permanent rift. I’ve always felt that this is my fault and that I should have considered the fact that the others might be rude in talking to her and that the whole group together, although a lot to handle, might have been better. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern would be Peter. H needs to understand better how to conduct himself around the FOPpers. I am most concerned about him because he is instilling a competitive vibe in the group and is most likely intimidating some if not all of the FOPpers. Besides the proposed race to put up the tarps, he is coming up with scary stories that may also be making people feel uncomfortable. I list this as my primary concern because we as the leaders are being looked up to by all of the FOPpers and any behaviors we exhibit might be taken up by one of the kids. I would most likely pull Peter aside, which would not look unusual to anyone, and remind him of the training we went through to become leaders and of the safe and welcoming environment we are supposed to be creating. I would also comment on his eye rolls with Philip and remind him to be polite and respectful of everyone. I would be friendly but stern with him and hopefully one conversation would be enough to settle this.

My second concern would be the little groups that seem to be forming and possibly excluding others (even if not on purpose). Specifically I am concerned with Renee feeling out of place in Lizzie and Matilda’s conversations about vacations and Daniel feeling ignored by Philip. With Renee, it seems that she has become extremely uncomfortable due to the fact that she probably never went on extravagant family vacations around the world because her family couldn’t afford them. With Philip, he seems to think he is better and more mature than the rest of the group and is ignoring Daniel because he wants to talk with Peter. These rifts are my second concern because if we don’t do anything about them, they could get worse and someone could end up feeling really hurt. I would first try to speak to Peter and come up with a plan where we all sit together and generally, not calling anyone out, remind the FOPpers of the importance of inclusion and connection. I would simultaneously playfully suggest that we switch up the order of hiking and mix the FOPpers up, which might also help Kelly and Jack out. If I still saw certain people feeling left out, I would pull them aside individually and discuss their concerns, as well as pull aside the individuals playing a part in the exclusion. 

My third concern would be Kelly. The shivering and giving away food might just be because she gets cold easily and truly doesn’t eat a lot, but it could also be about something else. Here I would think carefully before approaching her with my concern because I wouldn't want her to think I am accusing her of anything that will cause her to pull away even more. I would, however, pull her aside and simply tell her that I am concerned and hopefully she would open up to me.

Summer 2013—regular hikes with family and friends.
August 2013—FOP backpacking trip B. 
	In 2012 I went to a two-week camp in Sewanee, TN. Sewanee is absolutely empty and absolutely beautiful. I spent as much time outside as possible, hiking, swimming, and exploring during those two weeks. Being outside in the woods was like being transported to another world, a gorgeous—at times, almost fantastical—world removed from the stress and drone of everyday life. But also because it reminded me that there is an entire world completely separate from essays and psets and bank statements and laundry. Outside, none of that matters. During experiences like FOP, you don’t even have time to worry about those things because you’re too busy taking care of your basic needs—food, shelter, water, warmth. Nature is also the last unplugged territory. There are no cell phones or computers or screens of any kind on FOP. Thank goodness.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I am a good listener and communicator. This means I give clear, decisive directions. This also means I would connect well with my Foppers, make them comfortable in this perhaps new and challenging environment, and hear their fears, worries, and hopes about both the trip and college in general. I’m also very good at observing social dynamics, so if anyone seemed distant or uncomfortable, I would be able to bring them back into the group. I also have a positive attitude and—I’d like to think at least—I’m a pretty humorous person, so I think I would keep the group moving and morale up even in tough situations. I am cool under pressure, especially when other people are relying on me to think clearly. So, if we ever did get into a dangerous situation, I trust that I would respond quickly and effectively instead of panicking. I am also a good compromiser. I like to talk things out instead of being stubborn, so if a conflict arose or if my co-leader and I disagreed about a course of action I would be able to find a solution as easily as possible. Finally, I am adaptable. If plans change unexpectedly, I am willing to change with them and make the most of whatever the new situation is. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[When the going gets tough I get funny. Most of the time I start cracking jokes. However, when the going gets really tough, sometimes I just get quiet. I think this is something I would have to really be aware of, because I wouldn’t want my Foppers to lose momentum. I would also probably relate to my Foppers as a friend, which I think is a good thing most of the time. However, I worry that if any situations arose where they really just needed to listen to and do what I say, they might not see me as an authority figure. Finally, I don’t have a lot of experience in the wilderness. However, I’m sure Fop training will more than prepare me to lead a trip. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One of my friends invited me to spend a week over winter break staying with her and her dad in Florida. At first it seems like a pretty simple decision—Florida, in winter, heck yeah. However, there were more factors to consider than just do I want to go, and I wasn’t even entirely sure of that. So, the first thing I asked myself was “Is this feasible?” I needed to know how I was going to get there, how I was going to pay to get there, and if my parents would let me go. All of those things worked out, so next I sort of weighed the pros and cons of going: what would I gain from going and what would I miss out on by going. There were a couple things holding me back: I would miss out on time with my brother and other friends, I would have more freedom if I stayed home, and I might feel a little socially awkward spending a week with her dad who don’t really know. At the same time, I knew part of the reason I’d been invited was to ease the tension between my two hosts and my friend could use my support. Ultimately, I decided to go, but stay for 5 days instead of seven so I could hang out with my brother a little more before he left for school.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	One of my biggest concerns is Renee’s increasing withdrawal from the group. She’s growing uncomfortable and has begun distancing herself from the other foppers. Considering that she started growing quieter after Lizzie and Matilda started discussing their family trips abroad, I’d suspect that Renee might not have the same experience. She’s from a small town and might not have had the same opportunities. Perhaps she is coming from a less privileged background and feels like she either can’t contribute anything or can’t relate to the other girls any more. If this isolation persists, this trip could end up as a negative experience for Renee. If she is socially unhappy she will also struggle more on the trails as well. Also, one person’s isolation can reverberate throughout the whole group. It will be harder for everyone to feel comfortable together. In order to combat this, I would return to earlier conversation that Renee participated in. On the trail the next day I would rearrange hiking order in the hopes of Renee joining in conversation with her fellow foppers. I would play nouns in a bowl or something similar that makes everyone laugh and bond. If her isolation persisted, I would talk to her separately and ask how she was doing. I would also ask Peter if he’d noticed anything. 
	I am also concerned with Philip’s attitude. He’s uninterested in socializing with the other foppers and even seems to think he’s better than them because he’s older. Peter also seems frustrated with him. I am worried because I don’t want the other foppers, especially Daniel, to feel rejected or uncomfortable or not good enough in some way. I also don’t want Philip to miss out on the opportunity for really meaningful friendship that Fop provides. In order to combat this, I would try to point out some shared interests or similarities between Philip and the other foppers like both you and Mark really like these kinds of movies, or something like that. I would also team him up with another fopper to do a task like gathering water. I would also do more bonding activities because those only help with group cohesion. Finally, I would definitely talk to Peter and let him know that I was starting to sense some annoyance. 
	Finally, I am concerned about potential flooding. There was a thunderstorm earlier in the day and, since our campsite is situated in a valley, if it does rain, it will collect right where we set up camp. Flooding is obviously bad news. If everyone gets soaked, not only will they be absolutely miserable, but they could get sick or dangerously cold at night. So, if possible, I would set up the tarps on a slight incline so that if it does rain, the water will flow around us instead of pooling underneath the tarps. I would also make sure the p cords are especially tight. I would make sure the food is tightly sealed and I would tell all the foppers to sleep in rain gear or at least have it handy.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I am very outgoing and energetic and I think there is a certain kind of energy that I could bring to the group that would help first-years feel more comfortable, and excited during their time on FOP. Additionally, I am very organized, a good communicator and enjoy taking on leadership positions. I have experience being a positive role model throughout my life because I have three younger siblings. Also, I have a lot of experience in teaching and mentoring younger kids and I know that I could take what I have learned in those diverse mentoring and teaching settings and put them to use during FOP. I have really enjoyed all the previous mentoring and teaching I have done and I know that it has shaped the person I am today in a very fundamental way. So in that sense, I want to continue this growth with becoming a FOP leader. Finally, I defiantly would not categorize myself as an “out-doorsy” kind of person, I mean don’t get me wrong, I really have come to enjoy backpacking and I love to be active, therefor I think I could relate well to some first-years who are a little apprehensive about the outdoors. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>I think my greatest challenge in leading a FOP group would be that I am very much an extrovert and sometimes I have a harder job connecting with people who are more introverted. However I think this could easily be fixed with making sure that my co-leader is more of an introvert.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[During my NOLS India course I had to make a hard decision as leader of the day which it did not make a lot of my peers happy but in the end we were safer for it. Towards the end of our time hiking in the Himalayas we would have to make it to our campsite without our instructor team helping to guide us. On this particular day I was voted to be the leader of my small group in order to get us to the campsite by nighttime. It was about 6:30pm and it had been a very hard day of hiking, including awful rain towards the later afternoon. The sun was starting to set and we couldn’t find the pass that we needed to get over in order to find the campsite. But we knew we were close and many people just wanted to push on into the dark. I made the decision that it would not be safe to keep pushing up the mountain in the rain and dark. So to the disappointment of some of my peers, we went all the way back down the mountain and set up camp there. I decided it was best if we woke up early the next morning in order to find the original campsite and that night I worked very hard to keep everyone’s spirits up. The decision I made was not a popular one after a long, hard day of hiking and feeling like we were so close. But it was the safest and most responsible decision I could have made. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[First I think I would defiantly need to have a talk with Peter my co-leader. It is very important on trips like this that the leadership team is a cohesive unit and that they are doing a good job of sending out the same message to the people they are leading. If the relationship between the leaders gets broken you can’t expect the group dynamics to work smoothly either. I would encourage Peter to find a common ground between Philip and Daniel and tell Peter that even though he might not agree with some of the things that Philip says he should try to keep it to himself and not roll his eyes. Also during the last part Peter wants there to be a competition to set up the tarps. I don’t think this is a good idea. On group expeditions like this the last thing you want to do is make it a competitive environment, FOPers should be encouraged to work together in order to foster a community spirit. Also what Peter is suggesting does not seem safe if the sun is setting and we are all running around setting up the tarps near a dangerous caves. Secondly, I would keep a very close eye on Kelly, it makes me nervous that she is always shivering and giving up her food so quickly. I also think I would try to foster a relationship between Kelly and Renee because it seems like they are both quiet and would benefit from each other’s company. Finally, I think the major problem with this scenario is there seems to be a lack of unity that isn’t making for a positive group experience. I think it would be really important to bring everyone together before our five mile hike the next day. It would be a good time to play a team building game or have a bonding kind of chat. There needs to be some kind of common ground so that everyone is in more of a cohesive space for the next day and the rest of the trip. ]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2>I am a very passionate individual when I can completely get behind a cause. Being through FOP over a year ago I can still attest that FOP was the most enjoyable and arguably the most important experience of my time at Harvard. I fully believe in its cause. I understand the mission of providing a fun, safe, and comfortable environment for incoming students to integrate into life at Harvard. FOP helped me become comfortable at Harvard, and now I want to be able to do the same thing for a group of incoming students. My passion for what FOP is trying to do will be overwhelmingly evident in my role as a group leader. I am also very proficient in difficult circumstances. I have been faced with many decisions that require a calm disposition while not losing sight of the importance of the decision. When a difficult situation presents itself, which will inevitably happen, I have no doubts that I will be able to face it with a cool head and make a commendable decision.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>Occationally on FOP I found myself growing restless when we would take breaks during the hiking portion of the trip. I do not believe that my urgency to continue was ever very apparent, however, I can definitely improve on accepting breaks as something that is important and embracing them. </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>During the spring of my senior year I had the opportunity to compete in the USA National Team World Wrestling Trials. The trial tournament was scheduled to take place in Colorado Springs, CO. Attending this tournament meant missing the final week of high school; missing some of the final precious few memories with my classmates who I had spent so much time with over the last four years. I would have to stay in a rundown motel ten miles from the tournament location with no mode of transportation. I did not know anyone.  I decided that I would attend the tournament.  I was utterly alone and uncomfortable, but I knew was that this tournament was important to me and that I would not let any excuse keep me from competing. I grew up a lot during that trip. Although I did not fair as well as I would have liked to in the tournament, I realized that if something was important to me, I had to pursue it, and pursue it to the best of my ability. There are a couple things that I hold as very important in my life, but when something is important to me, I will do everything I can to pursue that aspect of life without regrets. </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The top priority as a FOP leader is the safety of the FOPers, both emotionally and physically. There are a couple areas where I question the emotional or physical safety of FOPers in the hypothetical FOP trip. Regarding the importance of safety, the three concerns that I find most pressing are as follows: Renee’s inclusion in conversation, Kelly getting enough nutrition, and Peter treating FOPers with respect. 
	Renee, who was originally comfortable talking with Lizzie and Matilda, has grown increasingly uncomfortable with talking to them. I would address this divide by talking with Renee and assuring her that people will not judge her for her background. One thing that Harvard celebrates is the range of backgrounds that its students come from. I would emphasize that she was getting along great with both Lizzie and Matilda before her financial background came into play, and since that should not matter she can still be friends with the two girls. 
	Whenever a question of physical wellbeing presents itself one must act quickly because a small problem can be magnified when outdoors. I would ask Kelly to help me do a task away from the rest of the group and make sure she knows that she can feel comfortable talking to me about how she really feels. When asked how she feels she may be afraid to tell the truth because she is around new classmates who she does not want to judge her in any way. After allowing her to be completely comfortable I would let her talk. If she is sick then I would talk to Peter and probably use the emergency phone to call for help. If she is not sick, but just uncomfortable eating in front of others I would try to emphasize the importance of nutrition on the trip, realizing the delicacy of the subject. Through talking with Kelly she would not have any doubts that Peter and I really care for her and that she should feel comfortable and excited for the rest of the trip.
	Although nothing Peter has done is malicious I would talk to him about how he may be perceived by the FOPers. FOPers should be comfortable talking and sharing with their leaders. Even if Peter does like all his FOPers it is important that he is reminded of how his actions may be perceived. I am sure that Peter is an upstanding guy, but a reminder of how he may come off to those looking up to him is important.
	Although these instances are specific there are certain situations that require addressing quickly in my mind. Anytime a FOP shows signs or is presented with a situation that may evoke emotional or physical stress that is a red flag for some action from a FOP leader.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[This summer I stayed at an MIT fraternity house and fully organized a two night camping trip for 10 of the people I met there. This involved planning out what kind of foods we might need, transportation, renting (and learning to use) stoves from the Outing Club here at Harvard, and making sure we had all the necessary supplies for two nights in the woods. I did research and picked a good seven mile hike in the White Mountains of New Hampshire that peaked twice and ended at a concealed swimming hole popular with hikers who frequented the area. I also ended up contacting National Forest rangers before the trip in order to make sure we were adhering to any rules and regulations in the forest. Because of this call I knew we had to camp certain distances off the trail and that bear bagging was essential. On a later trip I spent a couple days hiking through the Green Mountains with my older brother. I believe these experiences have really given me a good grasp on all the organization needed to lead a camping trip and have prepared me to be a better FOP leader.
I also believe that this last year at Harvard has given me more time to learn as much as I can about the university. My experience with and knowledge about classes, extracurriculars, and house/dorm life will make it a lot easier for me to answer any questions the incoming freshmen may ask and give good advice.]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[	I’m the second oldest in a family of five kids, a birth order which often left the role of mediator up to me. You don’t grow up in a big family without learning a thing or two about conflict resolution. We all had different interests, and often we couldn’t agree on everything, but we still had to live together and couldn’t let any conflict escalate too much, at least if we didn’t want Mom or Dad involved. We often had to settle and solve our own problems. Coming from this background I think I learned a lot about how to unify people with unique interests and how to deal with diverse groups of people. This quality is especially important in a FOP leader because the kids in each group are randomly assigned, but must still function as one unit and get along during a long, sometimes stressful week in the woods.
	I also believe that my experiences at Harvard and my enthusiasm for life at college will help get freshmen excited about entering college and maybe dull some nerves. As a current sophomore I believe I know a lot more about what Harvard has to offer and can help freshmen who have questions about housing, classes, extracurricular, or just life in general. I think when you have someone that is generally excited about what they’re doing it can rub off positively on the people around them.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I believe that one of the biggest challenges of being a FOP leader is creating a group dynamic that fosters relationships that last far beyond the woods. To this day, a year and a half out from my own FOP experience, I still remain close with the friends I formed there. I want to be the type of FOP leader that brings people together and lets them see the best in each other. I want to make FOP an unforgettable and defining experience for my FOPpers so that their first memories of Harvard are good ones.
	This brings up a good point: this is the first taste of Harvard many of these freshmen will have. That means that FOP leaders are some of the first people that the freshmen will look up to and go to for help in a new environment far from home. As FOP leaders, not only are we responsible for making the trip enjoyable and forming friendships, but we are also responsible for making sure that the freshmen have someone they feel comfortable asking for help and guidance from. Making sure that you’re approachable and helping freshmen in any way you can, even after the trip, is another major challenge and important part of FOP.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I’ve been taking piano lessons for 13 years, but I wasn’t sure if I wanted to continue taking lessons in college. I knew enough to keep teaching myself, but without the guidance of a teacher I didn’t think I’d keep up my dedication. I was also concerned that I wouldn’t have time to pursue everything that Harvard had to offer if I was taking piano lessons. I didn’t want to put a limit on myself before I had seen the student groups and activities Harvard had to offer.
In the end I realized that could continue to enjoy the piano without taking formal lessons. Maybe I wouldn’t practice regularly without a teacher to motivate me, and maybe months would go by where I didn’t touch the instrument, but if I truly enjoyed it, then if I saw an opportunity to use my skills I would take advantage of it.

A year and a half later, I think I’ve made the right decision in becoming an independent pianist. I volunteered with Mihnuet, playing piano and sharing music at nursing homes on the weekend. I’ve also used my music to meet more people in my house by playing the piano for the Kirkland play Kiss Me Kate! (aptly named). Piano never really left my life. Even after I had stopped taking lessons I continued to learn and have fun. It’s given me so many positive experiences, and I am so thankful for having the privilege to take lessons when I was younger.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern is Kelly’s health during the backpacking trip. Today we hiked extra-long and in a storm, and tomorrow we will be tackling a difficult 5 mile hike and I want to make sure that she has the energy to do it without getting hurt. If she’s shivering and giving away her food, she might be cold because she hasn’t had enough to eat. Next time she offers to give her food away I would decline for the group before anyone could ask for it and remind her lightly and playfully that we’ll need as much energy as possible for the coming hike. I won’t be too pushy, however, because if there is something larger at play, like an eating disorder, I don’t want to make her feel forced to eat and aggravate it. However, I want to encourage her as much as I can to eat more without making her feel uncomfortable or crossing any lines.
Another concern I have is the largely excessive amount of weight that Mark is carrying. Everybody should be doing their part carrying things on FOP not only because it is fair and builds a good team, but because Mark could get physically hurt from carrying that much weight. It could be very difficult to get Mark medical attention if he strains something in the middle of the hike. On my own trip we had a girl whose knee started to give out because she was carrying slightly more weight than the rest of us, and it made the end of our FOP trip more dangerous and less enjoyable. I don’t want that to happen on this FOP trip
A third concern I have is the number of pairing ups that are occurring on this trip. It seems like Mark and Suzy and Lizzie and Matilda are spending a lot of time with one another. Additionally, Daniel is spending a lot of time talking at Phillip, who is in turn spending most of his time talking to Peter. This also leaves three FOPpers, Kelly, Jack, and Renee, who are left out of the conversation. I think it’s important to make sure that people don’t just focus on building one relationship, but on building many. As a FOP leader, I want to include everyone in our experiences. I would talk to Peter about my concerns, and together we could devise a way to steer things towards group conversation where everyone participates, even if it’s just a little bit, to foster the group dynamic of our hikers.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[July 2012: I spent 6 days trekking through the Himalayas in Ladakh, India. We hiked at elevations up to 14,000 ft. for about seven hours a day, and the there were significant changes in elevation each day, so the trekking was pretty rigorous. We carried packs with all our personal belongings and food for lunch and snacks, but we stayed in villages every night so we didn’t have to carry food for dinner or sleeping bags. The trip was completely planned out by the organization, Putney Student Travel, so I simply participated. 
August 2012: Day hikes in Banff and Jasper with my family, I helped pick trails and prepare food, water, bug spray, etc. for the hike.
December 2012: Hiked Mount Monadock with my school’s Outing Club. Again, the trip was already planned and I simply did my best not to slip on the ice.
Summer 2013: Hiked Mount Monadock with two friends, helped pick the route and prepare lunch, etc. for the trip.

		<Q7.2>I think my time on my crew team and on my trip in India have both given me a good amount of experience in fostering group dynamics and in using physical challenges to push yourself and those around you to grow. A huge part of being successful as a boat in crew comes from trusting and supporting your boat mates, which is something I always put conscious effort into promoting. For example, the boat I rowed in junior year would meet to debrief after practice, created our own traditions, and really work to set goals as a boat. My trip to India also put emphasis on group dynamic because it was a small group of nine kids traveling together for 5 weeks, so making sure that no one felt left out or excluded was pivotal to making the trip a success. This was also really important because our group had varying levels of fitness and the trek was physically demanding, so the people who wanted to hike faster had to be patient and understanding of those who were having a much harder time. At times we also redistributed the contents of our packs so those who were having a harder time could hike with less weight. We also had to support each other when others got sick, which, being in a foreign country, could have been really scary had it not been for the support of the group. </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think it would definitely be a challenge at first just to figure out the transition from being a FOPer to a FOP leader. This is partially because there’s so much more responsibility and much more work that you have as a FOP leader, but also because I think it would be an interesting challenge to figure out how to distinguish myself as a leader and not a FOPer. When I was a FOPer and just trying to make friends with everyone else on the trip, I didn’t have to think about what respective positions we had in the group, so I think it would be a new and interesting challenge to become friends with my FOPers while still keeping that separation, especially because I would probably be at most a year older than my FOPers. Similarly, something my FOP leaders did was keep all their conversations and the general logistics of the trip, including the time, completely secret from us, and doing that as a FOP leader would also be a challenge for me.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[My senior season of crew I made the decision to transition from rower to team manager because of a shoulder injury I had sustained the previous spring. I had the option of continuing to row, even though I would almost certainly have had to stop halfway through the season because of my shoulder injury, but I decided, although I deeply wanted to row, that it would be best for both my own health and the team if I didn’t row and stayed on as manager. Because crew is a sport in which every rower on the team races and cohesiveness of boats is incredibly important, I knew if I had had to stop rowing halfway through the season, it would disrupt almost all the boats on the team and a girl who had been practicing on JV would have to switch teams halfway through the season. Deciding to stay on as manager was also an incredibly difficult decision because it was hard for me at first to watch everyone else row, and I sometimes felt like I wasn’t doing as much for the team as I could. But I remembered that when I was an underclassman on the team, the seniors had meant so much to me, and ultimately as manager I had a lot more time to mentor younger rowers, talk to them about the stresses of school and crew, and form really valuable relationships with them, which was always the most important part of the team to me.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern is be the way Renee is responding to Lizzie and Matilda’s conversations and the fact that she seems to be growing quieter and less comfortable. I think one of the most important tasks a FOP leader has, besides keeping everyone safe, is making everyone feel like they are really part of the group. Helping incoming freshmen feel more comfortable and confident about starting college is, in my opinion, one of the main goals of FOP, and I think forming a tightly knit group that includes everyone is imperative to making all FOPers feel this way. Renee is likely going to have to deal with this same challenge of meeting and trying to connect with people who come from different socioeconomic backgrounds once she gets to Harvard, so I think it’s really important that she feel like she is capable of doing so before she starts school. One way that people in my FOP group really bonded was by playing word games while we were hiking instead of talking about ourselves, so I would probably respond by initiating a game of Orange Crush or some other game that would get Renee talking and allow the girls to bond without talking about their upbringings. 
	My second concern is the fact that Mark is taking on so much weight, partially because it seems like that could be a dangerous situation if he is carrying more weight than he really should be, and partially because carrying the group gear is supposed to be a team effort, so Mark carrying all the team gear removes some of the teamwork aspect of the trip. Occasionally my FOP leaders would divide up the group gear before they woke us up, so I would probably take that approach to keep Mark from carrying all the gear. 
	My last concern is how quiet and separate from the group Kelly and Jack are. It seems like they are not really having a positive experience on the trip and don’t really feel like a part of the group. They are probably both a little shy and don’t really feel comfortable talking about themselves with a group of near-strangers. I think in this situation as well playing some sort of game that requires participation from every player would be really useful in getting them to open up and feel more included and talkative. The details about Kelly shivering and not eating all of her food might also indicate a more serious problem, but with that situation I would definitely be careful to not jump to any conclusions. I would probably keep an eye on Kelly to make sure she was handling the hiking okay and first try to help her feel more integrated and comfortable with the group to see if that improves the situation before taking any other measures.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[In the past semester, I have been training to become an Outing Club leader. Through the Outing Club, I have gained outdoor skills such as knot-tying, using stoves, setting up camp, navigating with a map and compass, wilderness first aid (WFA), and soft leadership skills in the wilderness. The Outing Club has given me many of the skills that I would need to be a qualified leader for FOP. I applied these skills to my training trip in which I acted in the leader role and practiced medical simulations. I believe that this experience has prepared me to re-apply to FOP with a new knowledge of the outdoors and an awareness of the skills needed to thrive as a FOP leader. ]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think my greatest strength would be my ability to be an emotional support for others and to give reassuring advice. I believe that I am a good listener with whom people often feel comfortable sharing worries or seeking comfort. I understand the amount of anxiety and uncertainty first-years come burdened with at the beginning of FOP, and I think I would especially look forward to leading the “processing” activities at the end of each night and working through any fears or insecurities that first-years inevitably come with. I’m often very warm with people I’ve just met, and can usually gain a person’s trust fairly quickly. I have a passion for the outdoors that makes being a FOP leader particularly appealing to me over other pre-orientation programs. I was on the cross-country team and run regularly, so my fitness and endurance are also a valuable strength for FOP. I’ve often been in leadership roles where responsibility and dependability were necessary, and I feel that having a group of first-years relying on me for physical, mental, and emotional support would not worry me. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[The challenge that I perceive I would have is the need to keep energy high and to create an immediate sense of community and liking among the first-years. Although I’m personable in one-on-one situations, I haven’t had much experience trying to create an immediate environment of fun and belonging in a group from the very beginning. I do have experience as a camp counselor for middle school students, but fostering that feeling among first-year students not much younger than me should be a new challenge. As an introvert, I usually need time to recharge socially. Because FOP requires constant presence and exposure to the first-year students, there will be times when I definitely have to overcome my desire to take some alone time in order to be a strong and enthusiastic leader. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[When I was applying to colleges during my senior year of high school, I always dreamed of moving to the west coast. Having grown up around Boston my entire life, I wanted to live in an environment where outdoor sports could be year-round and I could finally abandon my Michelin-Man-shaped winter jackets. But halfway through my senior year in high school, my mother was diagnosed with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). By the time the doctors found the tumor, its large size indicated that it had been inside of her for quite a while. The tumor was immediately removed in surgery, but the doctors, upon analyzing the tumor, found that there was a 50% chance that the cancer cells had already spread to other parts of her body and that the cancer would recur. 

Suddenly, I realized that going to college away from home wasn’t going to be as simple as I thought it would be. After my mother’s diagnosis, I still clung to this idea that somehow things would work out and that I would be able to live in the west coast as I had hoped. Soon, as colleges returned their decisions and the deadline for my own was impending, I was torn. I had no idea whether her cancer would recur, and if it did, how much time that would give her. If so, being close to home would be the clear best choice for my mother and for the family. But, I told myself that college was the perfect opportunity to explore a lifestyle that I had always wanted to live. I could always move back to Boston afterward, I told myself. California was an unexplored frontier, on the one hand driven by media idealizations of golden coasts, but on the other hand spurred on by my simple and understandable desire for something, anything, new. Ultimately, however, no matter how alluring California would be, I could not justify putting my sense of adventure ahead of a woman to whom I admired and felt deeply indebted. As I have realized the truly miniscule difference between Harvard and Stanford compared to the difference that my mother has made in my life, I can know that I made the correct decision. 
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	In my opinion, the most pressing concern that I would address first is my lack of communication with Peter, my co-leader. While it may be forgivable that Peter took the group down the wrong trail for half a mile, that should not have been a decision that Peter made alone, as the scenario seems to suggest. Whenever we reach a fork in the trail that is not one hundred percent clear, even if we have a good guess at which way to go, Peter and I should be checking with the map and compass to make sure of our route. The fact that we got off-route is more an indication of our lack of communication than Peter’s lack of navigational skills. Furthermore, Peter announced the tarp competition seemingly without my knowledge. Therefore, the first thing I would do is check in with Peter more frequently. Not only would we discuss the route and practical matters, but I could also bring up the social issues in the scenario in order to get Peter’s opinion and to plan accordingly. 
	The second concern I would address is the effect that Lizzie and Matilda’s relationship is having on Renee. Based on the evidence, I would guess that Renee feels left out because of her different background. My first instinct would be to start a conversation involving one of Renee’s interests that might be able to incorporate other members of the group. Hopefully, the conversation would eventually include Lizzie and Matilda as well and they could connect on grounds more familiar and comfortable to Renee. I would also organize more group activities such as songs, games, or icebreakers to unite the group across possible cultural or socioeconomic divisions. The hope would be to take summer vacations and upbringing out of the picture and to let Renee connect with Lizzie, Matilda, and other members through avenues independent of background. If, after such activities, Renee continues to be taciturn and is clearly uncomfortable in the group, then I would talk to Peter and consider checking in with Renee at a meal break. We could understand more fully the source of her discomfort and brainstorm ways to address it more directly. 
	Third, I would want to address Phillip’s behavior and relationship with other members of the group. I would be concerned about Phillip, because his disregard for Daniel and his fellow participants can not only hurt Daniel but also disrupt the sense of group camaraderie that we would like to foster. If it becomes clear that Phillip elevates himself above the group, then resentment or possibly insecurity may radiate through the others and prevent them from fully embracing the group and enjoying the trip.  If Phillip is directing most of his attention to Peter, I would check in with Peter. First, I would make sure that Peter does not directly show condescension for Phillip by rolling his eyes. Second, I would suggest that when Phillip addresses one of the leaders, we make an effort to include other members in the conversation to open Phillip to the input of his fellow participants. For example, saying something like, “That reminds me of what Lizzie said earlier!” or “I would be curious to hear Mark’s opinion on this,” may stimulate conversation between Peter and other members of the group. Peter would hopefully realize that other members have valuable input to offer as well as the leaders.

FOP App
(I’m not wearing a tie in the woods. Therefore, I kept my application conversational, truer to who I am.)

2010
•	I served as a summer peer counselor on trips for at-risk youth. I supervised—and had a great time with—the kids at museums, beaches, and while using public transportation. In the fall, I continued my outreach by working with my sister at her Americorp post.
2011
•	I canoed 95 miles of Canadian waters over ten days with a summer camp. I portaged, set up tents, cooked food, really everything. T’was wild. Basically—in addition to the communal food, water, and tents—we could only bring along a toothbrush, a swimsuit, one pair of shorts, a t-shirt, sunscreen, and rain gear (note the absence of mosquito spray). You would’ve loved it, FOP Crew.

2012
•	Whitewater Kayak Guide
2012-2013
•	A “Link Crew” participant in my high school, for two years I helped assuage the anxieties inherent with entering a new school. This included meeting with incoming freshmen multiple times throughout the year and answering any and all of their concerns.
1994- Present
•	I live in a very wild and rural portion of MN. As a result, I’m no stranger to the woods, and I’m quite accustomed to living and having fun in it. Ten miles from my house, Jay Cooke State Park forms my second home. My second stop on Thanksgiving Break? Yeah, it was “Jay.” I grew up in the woods. Don’t let my mostly clean-shaven look fool you. From eating wild onions to snowshoeing under the moon, I’ve had the opportunity to experience nature, and I’d like to share my love of it with others.

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[As for other group leadership positions, I served as student council president and led the renovation for Cloquet’s homecoming. Additionally, I fulfilled a similar role acting as NHS president. 

While those traditional roles are fine and dandy, I pursued and created an infinitely more fulfilling role by starting and managing a non-profit event in Minnesota, The Northland Frisbee Invite. Due to the nature of events, it requires mass coordination and oversight, which has leant significantly to my growth and attention to detail. If you have the time, check it out at Northlandfrisbee.org. I also was a sponsored cyclist, requiring keen communication skills with businesses.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Look amigos. I’m a sociable dude. I love my people. My people love me. This will extend to the FOP group. Together, fused in Maine’s crucible, we will become a clan that will ascend to Harvard College’s highest ranks, firmly planting the FOP flag on whatever high precipices are to be found faster than an incoming linebacker summits Moody Mtn.  
But, I get it. We’re here to assess me, not how my FOP group will form an ultra-secretive, ultra-KUHL club known as the “Canoe and Paddles.” So, besides my affinity for people and general affability, I can think critically, analyze situations, and read nuanced social cues. Rooted in my genuine interest in people, I love listening and learning from others. And while Maine’s beauty contributed to a highly enjoyable FOP experience, the focused conversation that solitude forced remains the most important memory and valuable FOP quality to me. To facilitate those conversations between my Fopees is what truly fires me up (to those whom bag on prepositional endings, phrasal verb, son). And I think that enthusiasm and belief in the FOP program will form my greatest attribute. I believe in FOP, and, because I’ve had such a great experience, I want to do everything possible to ensure others have the same.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[Challenges
	Honestly, I think leading a trip through the rain, up a mountain, and with everyone hungry wouldn’t be the fondest of trip moments in the present, but they do form the fondest memories. That said, I knowingly accept the weather conditions FOP entails, and I enter the program aware of the less than optimal situations. So first, weather. Second, fostering an amicable atmosphere, because mine was so great, serves as one of the most important FOP challenges to me, and, while I don’t see this as a monolithic challenge, its importance adds some due pressure; we have to get the dynamic right. Additionally, if a FOPper were to become sick, as one did on my trip, I think it would be challenging ensuring that he or she gets the correct medical care.

Decisions Decisions
These past months have essentially acted as one continual decision. The freshman fall is essentially one huge algorithm. From questions ranging from “What to take?” to “What to join,” I essentially came in for a blind landing. The instruments I relied upon to make a somewhat smooth transition rooted in knowledge acquisition. Basically, I think talking with peers, pafs, and FOP Leaders; reaching out to departments, professors; keeping an open mind has helped me decide upon what has been a fairly successful semester (fingers crossed for finals). Moreover, I think one of the most important factors in decisions and one that requires continual honing is “knowing thyself.” College, through rigorous trial, helps you understand who you essentially are. That said, I don’t view my entire fall as a glorious triumph. I should’ve actually campaign for UC and probably stuck with crew. What I’ll relay to my group, though, is that everything here, even your regrets, serves as a learning experience—including the squid served by HUDS. While my decision, like yours, is ongoing—how to shape four years here—I hope adding my perspective to the FOP information pool helps with their upcoming decisions.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[-Summer 2013: Spent 3 months as a summer camp counselor at YMCA Camp Surf.  Was a counselor for 10-12 girls aged between 7 & 15.  Spent a lot of time in the water, lead & taught kayaking and outrigger canoeing once a week.  Once a week was in charge of the sleep out on the beach

Other than my experience from attending this camp as a child (since I was 9), I don’t have much outdoors experience.  However, after having spent literally all summer without going into a proper room once, I realized that nature and the outdoors is something that is really important to me, and I am really interested in doing something that brings me back to the experience I had this summer. I also have this dream of one day doing a backpacking trip in the summer in at Denali National Park.  I am really excited about it, and really would jump at the opportunity to be able to gain the skills to feel comfortable doing things like this.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[When it comes to positions of leadership, my strength is always in building relationships.  When I come into a group, I am of the mindset that the people are the most important part, and I am constantly looking to make sure that people feel that they are loved and supported.  Specifically with this trip, I think that I would be good at leading freshman before they get here because as I have grown here, I have realized that in this stressful environment, it is essential to have a solid system of support, and I don’t think that there is any better way to do that other than forming really solid bonds with each other before school even starts.  I would love to foster an atmosphere of strength and love and support with freshman, myself, and the other leader so that they come into Harvard with a solid foundation and support system.  I think that I am good at doing this, as I have had a lot of practice with all of the groups and organizations that I have been lucky enough to be a part of both at Harvard and at home.  I just honestly don’t think there is anything more important than making people feel loved, supported, and happy through their relationships, and I think that this is what FOP does. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think my most difficult challenge would be to figure out how to pull someone into the group and the fun who wasn’t necessarily into it, or had the “too cool for school vibe.”  This has always been a challenge when it comes to leadership with me, as I feel like a lot of my emotional and bonding tactics don’t work with people that just inherently don’t want to go there.  I think that in many cases, this can be a detriment to the overall vibe of the group, and that it is something that has to be dealt with as soon as possible.  The way that I would look at this situation would be to really communicate with the FOPer and try and get to know them, and figure out if the things that I usually use don’t resonate with him/her, what does make them tick.  I think that building relationships is really the key to it all, and so I think that that is the way that I would try approaching that difficult situation. 
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[The most difficult decision I have made to date has been the decision of my concentration.  I know that I can have a difficult time with making decisions in general because I am always one to think of every little “what if” and my mind sways back and forth constantly.  The most difficult thing in my studies was that my father has always pushed me to do something within the realm of math and science.  Yet I think I have always gravitated towards the humanities.  My freshman year, I was looking to figure out every way to make my father happy and to do something that I didn’t love and wasn’t passionate about because of the fear that my father would be “right” and that I wouldn’t get a job after graduation with a degree in the humanities.  Yet over the summer, I realized that my gut instinct was something that I had to follow.  I knew that I had to do things that I was really passionate about, even if there is a looming fear of employment in the background of my mind.  I am a firm believer in the idea that anyone can do anything they put their mind to achieving, and so I chose to follow my passions and pursue a degree in History and Literature, which I absolutely LOVE.  Looking back however, sometimes I wonder if I maybe should have challenged myself to do something that was difficult just for the sake of challenging myself. 
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The first concern I have is Kelly.  Hers is the most prominent because it seems like there is a health and safety issue at hand.  The fact that she is always shivering and isn’t eating much are not good signs, especially given the nature of the situation and distance from help if anything drastic were to happen.  I would have an immediate conversation with Kelly, making sure she felt comfortable telling me anything, and that she would definitely have my discretion (as far as that could go in terms of me needing to tell Peter - but that would be communicated very clearly) and would hopefully get to the bottom of what was going on with her.  After this conversation, I would probably end up having a conversation with Peter about what our thoughts are on the next action step. 

The second concern I have is Renee.  She obviously feels unable to connect to Lizzie and Matilda because of the nature of their discussions, and maybe a different lifestyle and the one word answers signal that she is not feeling supported or loved.  My immediate reaction would be to have a conversation with Renee and really make her understand that I am there to support her in any capacity and only care about her ability to bond and feel good about herself and her position in the group.  Hopefully, I would be able to get her to open up and express her concerns, and I would tell her a little about my similar experiences with this kind of situation with my freshman year roommates.  In terms of Lizzie and Matilda, I think that I would be looking to turn the conversations into group conversations about things other than their interests, things that are much more universal and where everyone shares common ground (things like would you rather etc.)  

The last concern I had was Kelly and Jack.  I think that while there are some people that are just always shy, that in situations like these, people are generally quiet until they feel more comfortable.  Thus, I think the silence from Kelly and Jack shows that they were not comfortable.  This would be huge for me because if people aren’t comfortable in a group, they are not feeling connected, loved, or supported, and I think that those things are the purpose of FOP.  Thus, my plan of action would be to really try and lead by example and spending a lot of time pulling information out of these two, and finding things that are really interesting about them (talents, etc.) and then praising them for those things.  Also finding things that they are really good at on the trip, such as lighting the flint or setting up tarps, etc, and really using those things to pull them into the focal point of the group for a time. The idea would be to get everyone talking about them, so they feel more connected. ]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2>My greatest strength as a student leader has consistently been my enthusiasm and energy for the communities that I love. It is difficult for me, for example, to suppress my passion for Kirkland House; I find satisfaction even in tedious hours spent putting up Christmas lights for the House winter formal. This enthusiasm and appreciation for community would translate well to leading a group of first-year students. My personal energy and warmth would I believe make clear the level of my investment in promoting a group in which all felt welcomed and valued. I would draw from my sense of optimism and my leadership by enthusiastic and positive example to create a space where first-year students could feel as though they were part of a community that supported them. I hope that my sense of enthusiasm would spread and sustain the positive tone of our trip and also encourage others to engage with the group. I believe this excitement and enthusiasm is absolutely necessary to building a FOP trip that supports and prizes all participants. I also love to teach and I believe my role as an enthusiastic instructor would help me lead students on FOP and generate community during and well after our trip. Considering each moment of FOP as an enthusiastic learning opportunity on all levels would engage first-year students and give them the tools and community with which to approach the Harvard experience. </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My greatest challenge in leading a FOP group would be to generate and sustain the enthusiasm for the experience in the face of discouragement or active opposition from a minority of first-year students. I would find it difficult to reconcile this disruptive force with a collaborative and positive majority of FOPpers. If one or a few of the students persisted despite repeated leader intervention in their attempts to damage the FOP group, it would frustrate me and make me feel as though they were seeking to undermine the integrity of the trip and its community. FOP should be a safe space where students feel comfortable and trusting with themselves and their fellow group members. This is especially true I have found when students feel particularly vulnerable in an outdoor setting and on the cusp of a completely foreign college experience. At such a point trust becomes an incredibly important part of the group dynamic and a mechanism to both allay anxieties and build community. Though in all likelihood a worst-case scenario, a serious violation of the principle of trust would prove challenging for me as a leader. I would draw on the support of my co-leader and together we would discuss the best way to approach the student(s) in question and what sort of conversation could help resolve this issue and how we might work with them to make our FOP community as safe, trusting, encouraging and positive as possible.     ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[The initiations of a student organization in which I am involved have traditionally been considered as a means of community-building through adversity for new initiates. This year in a planning meeting I and other members expressed hope for making the ceremonies more inclusive and positive, though few senior members of the magazine attended this discussion. During the night of initiations several older members began to heckle the new initiates and although this followed traditional procedure, I felt it inappropriate and out of line with the goals we had laid out in the week’s earlier planning discussion. This taunting, though perhaps accepted in the past, made me feel as though it undermined the new community I as a student leader had promised to promote. I felt an obligation to voice my concerns as a member of the organization, despite not sitting on the Executive Board, and directly confronted the senior members responsible. I wish I had possessed the foresight before the initiations to directly address those absent at the planning meeting to make the standard that I and others had agreed upon clear. Fortunately, other members responded to my comments with support and I realized that in speaking for myself, I had expressed the concerns of a larger community. The subsequent improvements were extraordinary: rather than harshly criticizing initiates, all of us began complimenting them, and, as the absurd competition to give the best compliment began to mount, everyone found this positive experience far more enjoyable than a critical environment. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[As a FOP leader, I would be directly responsible for the physical safety and well being of the first-year students on our outdoors trip. It is critical to consider that although the wilderness and its challenges may be a source of community-building and recreational enjoyment, the outdoors also require an incredible attentiveness to physical health in the case of complications. Kelly, one of the FOPpers on the trip, has been shivering during breaks and claiming that she “gets full quickly” while giving away her high-calorie food to other group members. As a FOP leader I would be concerned for Kelly’s physical health, especially considering that it has been a long day on the trail and will continue to be a challenging hike tomorrow. I would consult with my co-leader Peter and voice my concerns to him, citing my observations and that a previous check-in with Kelly did not improve the situation. I would then like to have a longer conversation with Kelly in private and hear her reflect on how she felt at the moment and explain to her our focus on physical safety on the trip. If Peter and I discovered that the situation was beyond our control, we would immediately call for a medical evacuation. If Kelly’s health could be improved on site, we would then take steps to ensure Kelly stopped shivering and received the calories she needed on a taxing hiking trip to keep in her in the highest physical health.   

The importance of FOPpers’ physical safety I believe applies not only for the duration of the trip, but also the transition to life at Harvard. Daniel has made allusions to “getting trashed” and possible substance abuse while on the trail. While this may be simply an attempt to gain Phillip’s attention, it could also present a future safety issue. I would discuss my concerns again with my co-leader and seek to address this issue tactfully and effectively. One moment to discuss alcohol consumption at college could come during an after-dinner conversation with the entire FOP group. Rather than single Daniel out, my co-leader and I would stress the importance of safety and good judgment regarding alcohol to make our point anonymously. This could also include citing some of the same vocabulary Daniel used – i.e. “getting trashed” – and positioning it in a positive and thoughtful conversation where no one might feel accused or judged.  

A FOP-wide conversation could also be used to address the alienation that Renee might be feeling from the group. Peter and I could explain that FOP attracts a diversity of students from a wealth of backgrounds and socio-economic strata and that not all have had the same opportunities. In sensitively directing our address to the group at large, Peter and I could prompt Lizzie and Matilda without singling them out or reprimanding them. Hopefully in underscoring the positive and communal aspects of FOP, my co-leader and I would make clear that all are welcomed and valued in this community.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[My only serious outdoor experiences, excluding FOP, have all taken place at the state park 15 minutes up the road from my home in Belvidere, IL.  I would go out alone for a day or two at a time and explore the grounds.  It was the sort of place where you never ran out of things to find.  My friends and I would go together occasionally.  We’d hike, and canoe, and take note of anything of merit we’d come across.  I have no extensive wildlife survival training, but am eager to learn those skills.  I think it’s important for a person to know how to handle themselves in the wild.  There is a difference between being comfortable in the woods and being able to live in them.  I want to make the transition into the second category, while being able to bring a group of Harvard pre-frosh into the first.]]></Q6.1>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[The only real gift I’ve been given on this is Earth is warmth.  That gift does not make me a gifted mathematician, nor pianist, nor athlete; but it makes me a pretty mean teacher.   When someone is struggling, I know how to go down to their level and bring them back up again.  I’ve always been able to find the language someone needs to hear at any given moment to get themselves up.  More times than not I’ve been able to inspire people to move forward, and not around problems but through them.  I believe that the skills most important to being a FOP leader are the exact few that I have.  ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[Honestly my greatest challenge with leading a FOP group would be knots.  I despise knots with every fiber of my being and it is going to take me the FULL 6 MONTHS or so of preparation to learn how to tie pieces of rope in a way that can keep everyone alive for 7 days.  I’m confident I can figure it out given the time, but right now, from my couch in Wigglesworth D11, knots are my number 1 concern with getting involved here.   Perhaps you were looking for a more internal concern, something about my own personal composition that would make me… NOPE, its knots.  Honestly, just because I don’t have any serious know-how, most of the serious survival skills concern me.  I really feel I can do some good in this program, but I’m worried about the logistical hurdles of not having any really heavy duty experience.  ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[It was not the most extreme of decisions, but it would come to be one of my more important ones.  It was Halloween night my freshman year, and my friends had a large party planned at one of their houses, I forget who it’s not important.  My mother had been very sick, for a long while by then, and sometimes she would get lonely.  She would never speak of it, but I knew.  My little sister Kelly had already run off, and my father was out of town to some place or another.  It was just her and I.  I could’ve left too, and she very much wanted me too, but I couldn’t bring myself to.  She would never tell me to stay home and miss what she thought were important memories for her sake. I thought about her quiet loneliness and how that can grow to eat away at someone.  I thought about what she’d be doing if I had left, how she would feel if she were alone.  I was flooded with memories.  I remembered every childhood Halloween she went out of her way to make special, how much effort she put in to making me smile.  Suddenly I found myself too ill to leave the house that night.  And I have found myself too ill to leave the house every Halloween since.  That night turned into one of our most treasured traditions, and to this day I’m not really sure if she’s realized it’s a tradition yet.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[I get everyone to start setting up immediately; finishing quickly means eating quickly, and it also means less time for people to begin griping about Peter’s mistake.  Also, if possible, I’d tell everyone to throw on a pair of dry socks.  If it stormed badly enough, their feet could be soaked, making tomorrow miserable and dangerous.  I worry about Renee; if not careful she’ll walk into Harvard thinking she doesn’t belong.  If she’s up by me then that’s great, I can guide the conversation between her and the three or four people directly behind me so that she feels included.  I also take note to acknowledge Mark’s greater contribution to the group; I want him to know his extra efforts are appreciated, but I want to do so in a way that doesn’t make anyone else in the group feel like they’re of lesser worth.  Also I decide to keep an eye on the whole “Mark-Suzie” dynamic.  Even if their relationship isn’t approaching the “HOP on FOP” level, I worry about an exclusive relationship forming.  FOP is so special because it’s a group experience, and exclusive relationships compromise that.  The Phillip/Daniel/Pete dynamic is complicated.  I would say that Daniel wants to relate to Phillip and that Phillip wants to relate with Peter; each wanting to be just one step more mature than they actually are.  I need Peter, he’s my partner, and I can settle this issue without unnecessary conflict.  I just need to control the line order.  If I keep Phillip up front with me, just behind Renee, and I put Daniel a few people back from Phillip and within Pete’s sphere of control, then Pete and I can guide the conversations in a way that makes everyone happier.  I feel like Daniel might get along with Lizzie and Mitilda, and throwing him into the mix might also decrease the likelihood of an exclusive relationship forming between the girls.  If I still have problems with the Daniel/Phillip/Pete dynamic after the next hike day, I’ll take more direct action, depending on the nature of the situation after another day in the woods.  From the moment I see Kelly shivering, I make her throw a fleece on.  If she gets hot later she can take it off later, I’m not willing to take a risk here.  Also if I in any way feel Kelly isn’t eating enough, I’ll pull her aside and have a real talk about it.  I don’t want to make her uncomfortable, but I’m not taking any risks.  I will have her and Jack join Phillip, Renee, and I up at the front half of the line.  Slowly, I’ll start trying to bring them out of their shells.  I go back and check the tarps to make sure that, in the haste of Pete’s idea to see who can most quickly and shabbily throw together the shelter, nothing was done incorrectly.  We’ll talk a little about tomorrow at dinner; I’d like them to know what they’re walking into.

		<Q6.1>June 2010, 2011, and 2013- I went on three different week-long backpacking trips to Havasupai which is located in the bottom of the Grand Canyon. I went with a large group but I was responsible for hiking in all my own gear and food with a partner. This trip is a 12 mile hike into the bottom of the canyon where there is a river and amazing waterfalls. Each day, we did adventurous day hikes. I shared a tent with one of my friends and together we were responsible for all our meals and our camp set up. After our first year, we became very comfortable in this setting and helped other people when they came across major or minor difficulties. 
May 2013- I got my advanced scuba certification which required me to plan dives and dive routes. I know this is underwater so it is kind of different but a lot of the skills required for underwater navigation are relevant on land. For example, I had to use pre-established maps and information, compasses, and physical position markers to create the desired course. I also had to plan for the unexpected and emergency situations.
FOP 2013- Jessie Wyatt and Matt Lowe taught me how to tie knots and do all the other important FOP activities. I like to think I was a helpful, positive member of the trip who made others feel more comfortable during our trips but maybe not. If anything, I helped with the spice challenge. Mmm there was something special about curry in my maple and brown sugar oatmeal. 
All of high school- I was an active planner of hikes with friends in our local hills in southern California. My role was to get our group motivated and make sure we were prepared hydration and nutrition wise. 
</Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[I served as captain for my high school water polo team during my senior year of high school. This was important for my development because I had to learn to be understanding and accommodating to multiple people’s needs and concerns. It also gave me practice in communicating those needs or concerns to others, including my coach, a person of authority, and other teammates, my peers. I also was captain on my club water polo team during my senior year which allowed me to lead a different group in a more competitive environment which made me engage in a lot of comprehensive decision making. 
I also was on the Student Leadership team at my church at home. As a part of this team, I spent a lot of time organizing and planning events. I also was able to spend time talking to younger girls about their transition into high school and typical high school stuff from a Christian perspective and it helped me confirm what I believe and what I stand for. Serving as a mentor to younger girls was key in the development of my character and leadership. I was also on the Leadership Team for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes club at my high school, which entailed a lot of the same responsibilities. In the spring, I hope to get involved in a leadership role with HCFA here at Harvard.
The last responsibility I have held that I consider key to my development is my summer job. The last three summers I nannied for a family with two elementary school aged girls. I was responsible for managing their time and safety. It was important to me that I provided them with a comfortable environment and that they enjoyed the time we spent together.

		<Q7.2>My decisiveness would definitely be a strength in this leadership role. Making decisions come naturally to me and as I have developed as a person I have become more aware of what it takes to make a good decision. I also find some strange joy in being uncomfortable so challenges are fun for me. I imagine that no FOP trip goes without a challenge so I think my generally joyful and optimistic attitude could be beneficial in leading a group of first-year students. These two things together- my decisiveness and optimism- would allow others to feel more at ease and hopefully more optimistic and joyful as well. </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I really like to get to know people on a real, deep level so I think the biggest struggle for me would be eagerness to hear about people’s lives which could be unwanted by some. I’ve learned to be more understanding of different people’s personalities and levels of openness but I like to encourage people to share and sometimes it is a challenge to be patient in this. This impatience carries over to other parts of my life as well. In some situations, I stress efficiency too much and I think that may be a challenge as a FOP leader. Being able to slow pace could be a definite challenge. So I think over eagerness may be something that I would have to consciously control when leading a group of first-year students. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[After my junior year (summer 2012), I had to make the difficult decision not to go on the backpacking trip that I mentioned earlier. The decision was difficult for me because the prior two years had been a time of renewal and revelation and I was longing for that. Additionally, more of my friends were going than ever before and I wanted so badly to experience this place and week of adventure and spiritual experiences with them. When it came to make a decision about whether or not to sign up for the trip I was conflicted because it overlapped with the Junior Olympic qualification tournament for my club water polo team. I had made a commitment to my team and I had also put in a lot of work to get on the team. I was on this with the eventual goal of playing at a collegiate level in mind. I knew that if I didn’t stay for the tournament I would not be playing in Junior Olympics, which is the hotspot for college recruiting. I had to assess my long term goals and I came to the realization that I had made a commitment to myself, my parents, and my teammates to play and play well. In the end, I am really happy with my ability to recognize my long term goal of being here at Harvard. Had I gone on the trip, my college decisions would not have played out in the same way. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[At the moment, I think Kelly’s state is most alarming to me. It would be easy to let her slip under the radar because she is not being very vocal or drawing attention to herself. Giving up her desserts is concerning because it could be an indication of overall under eating. There are many reasons that could explain her eating habits, including stress or discomfort in her environment, eating disorders or insecurity about her weight, or she could be feeling ill. The fact that she is also shivering adds to the concern for her health.  With the cold night setting in, I would make sure that she puts extra layers on and early, as a preventative measure. Also, I would probably serve her more of dinner to subsidize for the loss of calories she faces when she gives away her other food. I think it would also be important to check up on her privately to see how she is feeling health wise. I would openly discuss my concerns with her and emphasize the importance of nutrition and hydration on the trip. 
I think the next concern would be to disassemble some of the cliques that are beginning to form. It is natural for friendships develop at different rates but it is important to make sure no one feels excluded or alone. The intermingling of everyone is the responsibility of the leaders so I think it would be best to have a private leader meeting to discuss how to encourage different people to talk. Also, this would be the right time to bring up the possible eye roll from Peter. 
This talk can wait until the tarps are set up and dinner is going. It is really important to make sure everyone stays well fed, well rested, and well hydrated. Tarp set up is key to do when it is light because people can work faster and with less errors. Also, it will allow for a more relaxed dinner time which is key time for group bonding and working on integrating all the cliques together.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[-September 2008: "Bivouac"--essentially a high school equivalent of FOP; I was required to pitch tents, help construct a lean-to, chop wood and build fires, cook over an open fire, dig drainage (it rained around our campsite... a lot)

-June 2012: Went on a road trip across the US with my friend. The two of us had equal share in planning overall including figuring out our route (while driving and when hiking) and getting food, though I usually found parks to camp out in each night. We also did numerous day and overnight hikes, mostly in the southwest (Gila National Forest, Grand Canyon, etc.).

-August 2012: A very passionate participant of Robyn Day and Joey Wall's FOP 44

-May-June 2013: Backpacked from Cape Town to Nairobi over the course of six weeks with Robyn Day. Again, she and I had a pretty equal hand in planning, which we mostly did as we went along. We largely traveled by train/truck/matatu, but also did a fair amount of hiking, most notably a long day hike up a small mountain in Malawi and in the last week when we successfully climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro. 

-August 2013: Overnight hiking with two of my friends in the Wild River Wilderness. The three of us planned the route together; individually I took responsibility for setting up camp when it turned out that one of my friends had forgotten his tent--we hit up a Wal-Mart on the way up, bought a painting dropcloth, and I remembered enough of what Robyn and Joey had taught me on FOP to set up a tarp for us to sleep under.

-October 2013: Overnight hike of the Baldface loop in the White Mountains with a friend--we hiked in to Baldface shelter in the evening, then did the loop the next day, allowing us to keep a fairly relaxed pace. I was wholly responsible for planning the trip, including securing transportation, acquiring a tent, stove, map, and food (and, when it turned out it was ok to build fires at the campsite, gathering wood and building a fire from what was available from fallen trees), and planning our route and campsite.]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[-Field training officer, paid, Brewster Ambulance: I technically wasn't an FTO, just a regular EMT, but while I was working full-time on an ambulance I was made responsible for training several new EMTs--essentially having them shadow me for a few shifts, then helping ease them into treating patients on their own under my supervision

-Teaching fellow, volunteer, CrimsonEMS EMT class: I have now TF'd three classes of EMTs, which consists of entirely practical instruction in taking vitals, splinting and immobilization, CPR, and patient assessment.

-Course assistant, paid, Astronomy 2 (Celestial Navigation): This semester I was one of two course assistants (along with Mike Danto) for Celestial Navigation, and was extremely involved in in-class practical instruction showing students how to take and reduce sights of celestial bodies using a sighting compass and sextant (aircraft and maritime), plot, and create plane table maps.

-Other positions of group leadership or responsibility include being concertmaster for an orchestra and music leader of an a cappella group in high school and (in this order) equipment officer, service officer, and chief of operations for CrimsonEMS.]]></Q6.2>
		<Q6.3><![CDATA[Most notable, I think, is the month and a half that I spent in Africa. It required me to do a great deal of thinking on my feet and in-the-moment planning and coping with unfamiliar situations--already things I would consider strengths, but I definitely got a lot more experience with them in Africa. I also got a great deal better at closely interacting with and getting to know complete strangers as Robyn and I improvised ways of getting around and were often thrown in with groups of people with whom we traveled or stayed for short periods of time. My familiarity with the outdoors was similarly increased by my hikes in Africa and New Hampshire this past summer and fall.

However, I think it's also worth emphasizing my CAing experience in Astronomy 2, which for any of you who are unfamiliar (bearing in mind that it's emphatically not the same class as primitive navigation) is an extremely hands-on class, even for the CAs. This, along with the practical instruction I've been doing for CrimsonEMS for the last year and a half, has given me a substantial new reservoir of teaching experience.]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think that this is in some ways a strange response, but I think my biggest strength in leading a group of first-year students would be how enthusiastic I get about welcoming new people to groups and experiences that I really, truly care about. This has been most evident in CrimsonEMS, which has over the last year and a half become a real labor of love for me. I always really enjoy TFing the class, particularly early on, because I love helping bring new people on board with something I care about as CrimsonEMS. I get so excited for the people in the class, who are starting out on a really fun and rewarding experience, that I can’t help but enjoy myself.

Even though it was at the beginning of freshman year, I still consider FOP to be something that has been similarly foundational and significant for me at Harvard to CrimsonEMS. Nothing could have prepared me better or made me happier or more comfortable coming into my first year here, and—as evidenced by the fact that we spent six weeks wandering around Africa together—my FOP leader Robyn Day became one of the greatest friends and role models I have ever had. It would be hard for me not to be incredibly excited for my FOPpers, and I think that that energy and enthusiasm would make the trip a lot of fun for everyone.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think the biggest challenges for me would be the logistical ones stemming from leading a sizable group of new students. I felt this way when I applied last year as well, and while I think I’ve gotten significantly better at generally managing logistics (again, working on the management side of EMS has involved a lot of this), I still have never done anything quite like leading a group of eight to ten first-year students outdoors. I know myself extremely well, and when I go hiking with my friends I know them pretty well too—thus, it’s never difficult for us to know how much or what to pack, and how to divide up responsibility. However, I’ve never really had to plan extensively for a large group of people whom I don’t know personally. I think that it would be pretty challenging to plan a route and figure out how to divide it up day by day and to determine exactly what equipment, food, etc. would be needed for people I hadn’t even met yet. As I understand it a lot of this is pretty standardized by trip level, trip type, and just generally within FOP, but there are still obviously big differences between trips. Figuring out the nuances of my own hike in a way that made sure things would go smoothly for a group of new students isn’t really something I’ve had to contend with in the past.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[When I went hiking this summer with my friends Suhas and Wilson, the three of us got a little overambitious with our route planning. Our intentions were to camp out at the trailhead, Wild River Campsite, and then cover 16.5 miles along a river, up to a ridge, and over four summits to our campsite. Even starting early in the day it was a lot to ask of ourselves, and as we scrambled up the unmaintained trail to the ridge, I felt myself tiring fast. 

At the junction on the ridge we paused for breath and prepared to head south to bag a nearby summit and double back. We had briefly discussed skipping this detour and heading north right away, but with three 20-year-old-male egos on the line, no one was eager to suggest easing the route. But during our water break, I began to think we ought to skip the summit—I was exhausted, and it already looked dubious whether we would be in before dark. Finally, I swallowed my pride and told my friends that, no matter how confident they felt, I didn’t feel up to the additional summit, and would feel better skipping it. It was tough to say, but even though my friends were a bit disappointed, they completely understood and we ended up having a great time even without the extra summit, managing a round 15 miles and getting into camp almost exactly at sunset.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[So, there are a lot of things happening here, but the thing that jumps to me as being much more immediate than any of the others is how Kelly is doing. Having seen some fairly extreme cases of it, my first instinct when I see someone who is noticeably eating less than other people and appears to be having more trouble staying warm is that it looks a lot like disordered eating and that Peter and I need to be keeping a pretty close eye on her and trying to encourage her to eat—in, of course, a way that doesn’t make her feel like we’re pressuring her or jumping to any conclusions. I would hope that this isn’t symptomatic of something larger and more severe, but in the moment she seems to be very hypoglycemic, and that’s something that needs to be addressed soon, particularly if the next day is going to be a fairly challenging one. 

The next thing I feel needs addressing is the overall group dynamic—specifically that the trip seems to be fragmenting pretty severely. My ideal FOP trip, and I would imagine others’ as well, is one in which everyone pretty much gets along with everyone. Obviously people will gravitate more to some individuals than others, but here it seems to be happening at the expense of the group as a whole. We can already see some of the negative externalities that this has led to (to use a phrase that my leaders were fond of)—Lizzie and Matilda seem to have become close very much at the expense of Renee, while Phillip’s apparent attempts to get “in” with Peter appear to be alienating Daniel. Meanwhile, it looks like these little personal interplays (including the situation between Suzy and Mark, which certainly has the potential to lead to problems of its own) have made Jack and Kelly feel like they don’t really have a place in the group. This is tough to directly address; it’s not like anyone can step in and order everyone to start getting along. But in camp this evening we could put together some whole-group activities and try to encourage some of the quieter members of the group to speak up a bit more. 

I’m also not thrilled at the notion of there being a competition to get the tarps set up; that’s not really the kind of dynamic I want to cultivate, and it seems symptomatic of another problem—Peter and I don’t seem to be on the same page. The fact that he’s setting up this competition, that he seems to have taken us down the wrong trail without a co-leader powwow, and that he was rolling his eyes at one of our FOPpers all worry me. I don’t think that we can really lead effectively unless we’re doing it as part of a team, so talking to Peter making sure that we’ll be communicating well for the rest of the trip is a high priority for me.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[Throughout my freshmen year, my FOP leaders have made my transition into college so much smoother. I greatly appreciate their advice and mentoring and so I want to do the same for incoming freshmen.  After over two semesters at Harvard, I have tried many Extracurriculars but simply haven’t found an organization like FOP that provides the intimate, introspective, and self-revealing experience that is so unique to FOP. There is something about the backcountry and the FOP experience that fosters the tight-knit, trusting, and caring community that I hope I can lead and contribute to. 
	This past summer, travelling to several new countries has made me more adept at adapting to new situations and navigating on new terrain. After teaching four classes of high school students about public health as a seminar leader, I gained more teaching experience that has made me more aware of ways to engage the student. As a mentor through CSA’s sibfam program where I act as a sibfam ‘parent’, I work to create a sense of ‘family’ for freshmen and learned how to be both a friend and a mentor who can be trusted to give valuable insight, perspective, and advice. As a teacher through the Chinatown afterschool program and Citizenship program, I learned how to approach things with patience and creativity.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[As someone who has moved around a lot, I am familiar with the anxieties of being new to a community and so I can relate to freshmen and help smoothen their transitions into college life. As someone who hasn’t always “fit in” or always ‘belonged’ to any one country, community, or ethnicity, I am always welcoming of diversity and differences that make for more interesting discussions and perspectives. I can welcome and engage people in a community to create a sense of belonging for every member.
 I like to connect to people by understanding their hopes and fears. By bringing people together to create a supportive community that people can rely on for advice and care, I can open up safe spaces for people to share their thoughts and aspirations. 
I am an introspective person and through quiet meditation, I have learned how to understand the subtleties of my own character. With this ability to deeply introspect, I can facilitate the process for freshmen to do the same as they begin to figure out who they want to be and how to pursue their passions. 
	After many challenges and failures, I’ve learned how to get back up, learn from my mistakes, stay determined, and how not to take things too seriously. I’ve learned how to stay optimistic and take each challenge as a learning experience. Similarly, the FOP trip will pose many new challenges for freshmen and I will be able to help them overcome and learn from each challenge. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[If I see how someone can improve and may benefit from some advice and guidance, I am still learning how to welcome people to come seek advice as opposed to approaching them directly. As with any mentoring position, it is important to learn how to share advice without pushing advice onto mentees. 

	In addition, though I was a FOPper and have some experience living in the outdoors, I am not familiar with skills needed to live independently in the outdoors. 

I have also become aware that when under pressure, I begin to have tunnel vision and sometimes fail to look at the larger picture. Luckily with this awareness, I’m working to avoid getting caught up with minor details.  

In addition, perhaps because of my fear of making mistakes, I am a slow decision maker. I like to take into account many factors, the pros and cons, and holistically look at all possibilities before making a decision. Though this process is important, I understand how some decisions must be made quickly when there is limited time and I am working on making the best decisions even during a time crunch.  
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[This past semester, feelings of sophomore slump seemed to have become a reality.  Uncertainties about the communities, Extracurriculars, or studies I wanted to devote to often occupied my thoughts. All the while, I applied for an opportunity to study abroad for the spring semester. When I heard of my acceptance, it seemed like a great way to avoid facing these challenges. 

In deciding, I considered the opportunities I could take on if I stayed on campus, the challenges I’d have to face, the classes I could explore, the friends I hoped to become closer to, the extracurriculars I wanted to get involved in and compared these options with the possibility of being abroad where there would be less academic stress, new exciting travel opportunities, and the opportunity to delve deeper into a language and culture. While the freedom and the opportunity to travel enticed me to study abroad, I ultimately decided that if I wanted to figure out who I wanted to be as a college student, it would be important for me to be on campus next semester to develop my presence and identity on campus before running away to another world. 

I decided that facing these challenges was the best way to figuring out what was important to me, what I wanted to study, the communities that I value, and ultimately who I want to be. Though the opportunity to study abroad seemed like that perfect way to leave my troubles behind, I decided to take the harder route and face these challenges as I strive to overcome them. 
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The three things that concern me the most are:
1.	how Daniel hopes to engage Philip by asking to ‘get trashed’ together, which indicates the wrong mindset about alcohol and perpetuates the negative habits of drinking culture. Daniel may believe that drinking as the ‘mature’ and ‘cool’ way to socialize in college. However, I would react by conferring with my co-leader Peter to see how we can address this issue with the FOPpers in an open forum so that they can all feel comfortable about how to approach alcohol once they return back to campus. An open forum can be a question and answer discussion where FOPpers can anonymously ask questions of both the FOP leaders and any FOPpers for their insight. I would then drop in a question about how to approach alcohol as a college student. 

2.My second concern regards Renee who is becoming more reticent perhaps because of her background that may not be as well off as that of Lizzie and Matilda’s. This is concerning because I believe everyone on FOP should feel comfortable in the group.
 
A way to address this issue would be to share stories of the diversity of people at Harvard and how everyone finds their own place regardless of family backgrounds and past experiences. While Lizzie and Matilda may be hitting it off, Peter and I could rearrange the hiking order to get Renee meeting and talking to other FOPpers again. 

Another way to reassure her would be to talk to her in a more intimate one on one discussion to see what may be bothering her and help her find ways to connect with FOPpers and accept background differences. 

Another exercise to do would be for everyone to anonymously write their background on pieces of paper, toss the paper into a mix, and then have everyone randomly read a slip out. This way, it’ll be evident that everyone comes from diverse backgrounds and this diversity is something to celebrate. 

3.	Finally, it concerns me that Peter may be rolling his eyes during Philip’s story telling. As someone who is older and more mature, it is understandable why Philip may look to Peter for friendship and feels a little disconnected from the other FOPpers. However, it is important for Peter and I to connect Philip with the FOPpers as they will become his classmates and he must deal with his sense of being ‘more mature’ when he returns to Harvard. 

In addition, though Peter may find Philip a little boastful, since it is a priority for FOP leaders to create a welcoming and inclusive group, I would remind Peter to be a little more tolerant and respectful when listening to Philip’s stories. Peter and I can also discuss ways to engage Philip with the rest of the group.

As director of the California Conservation Corps Backcountry Trails Program, he devoted his life to youth development through the maintenance and preservation of wilderness areas.  I spent my childhood hiking behind my father to visit and often assist trail crews scattered throughout California’s state and national parks.  In addition to a lifetime of backpacking, day hikes, and weekend camping trips, I have also accumulated the following outdoor experience over the past few years:
Summer 2010 – Worked as an enrollee for Youth Conservation Corps. Spent eight weeks in Yosemite National Park constructing and maintaining trails, removing invasive plants, and restoring campgrounds.
Summer 2011 – Spent two weeks visiting older brother’s backcountry trail crew in Yosemite National Park. Helped him set up basecamp, chop wood, and cook.
Spring 2012 – Spent two weeks backpacking and hiking through New Zealand with older brother and mother. Helped plan trip and carry my mother’s gear during the day. 
August 2013 – FOP Backpacking C trip in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Climbed up and over Mt. Washington.
October 2013 – WOOP backpacking trip in New Hampshire. Summited Mt. Tremont. Helped create group environment using FOP experience.
October 2013 – Kayaking trip with Harvard Outing Club. Eager and enthusiastic participant, despite lack of kayaking ability.

		<Q7.2>My father showed me the world from the edge of many a mountainous peak. He introduced me to the great outdoors, and when he passed away nature became my link to him. I learned to treasure that connection by calling on the woods for strength. Through experience, I have absorbed the therapeutic benefits of nature, and would find no greater pleasure than to share my passion and knowledge to future freshmen about to embark on an incredible educational journey at Harvard. I believe my comfort in outdoor environments and previous leadership involvement, dovetailed with my enthusiasm and optimistic attitude, would combine to make me an excellent candidate for leading a FOP trip.  I possess a uniquely positive outlook on life, especially when it involves waking up with the sunrise to embark on a 12-hour day of hiking. Furthermore, I take pride in my distinct sense of humor, profound goofiness, and uncanny knack of puns, which allow me to associate with people of varying age groups. I have no hesitation in my ability to quickly connect with my FOPpers and develop a relationship that will last far beyond the extent of our six-day trip. I also am confident that that I will easily bond with my assigned co-leader and create an extraordinary team that will lead yet another unforgettable FOP trip.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I anticipate my greatest challenge in leading a FOP trip would be encountering those unwilling to pull their weight in a team environment. In my opinion, the most important factor that contributes to a successful FOP trip is the creation of a tightly knit and comfortable group setting. Having grown up in a rural community centered on the vital role nature plays in our lives, I can sometimes be easily bothered by those less appreciative of the world around them. A transformative FOP trip is contingent on each individual experience, and it would be tragically unfortunate to see one FOPper’s attitude interfere with this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The physical and emotional challenges encountered on a FOP trip can be a prime opportunity for peer bonding when approached with open minds, but one individual can easily bring down an entire atmosphere. Dealing with such a FOPper may test my patience, but despite this potential challenge, I intend on welcoming it with open arms. I can imagine no greater joy than showing the world to someone who has never seen it. Hopefully, in the end, I can make the largest and most transformative impact in their life.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>Last November, tragedy struck my hometown of Arcata, California. A student in the grade below me, Geddie Kuljian, was swept out to sea alongside his family in a freak accident that rocked our community. As editor-in-chief of my high school paper and a part-time correspondent for the local city newspaper, I found myself caught in the mire of adhering to my tasks as a journalist and withdrawing from my duties to give myself time to mourn. I was torn to pieces as writers from the Associated Press began calling me and asking for assistance with the reporting. After much thought and moral dilemma, I recognized the opportunity to expand on my journalistic career, even though it meant partaking in an investigative piece that deeply affected myself on a personal level. In the coming days, as the sense of excitement began to fade, I felt a sense of guilt for immersing myself within the journalism coverage and not pausing to take the time to process the tragic events for myself. Although I do not necessarily regret my decision, I nonetheless felt conflicted about the outcome. Yearning to help Olivia, the surviving daughter and sister of the Kuljian family, I utilized connections to fellow National Honor Society members, local newspapers, radio stations, and the Arcata High School student body to help plan a dinner, dance, and silent auction benefit in honor of the Kuljians, with all proceeds going to Olivia.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Although this hypothetical situation presents a series of potential minor issues and disturbances, I would like to preface that I do not foresee any grave concerns that would inhibit this FOP trip from still being an overall good experience. That being said, I believe most of the issues within this group dynamic are reparable, and if resolved, could contribute to this trip becoming a defining and integral part of each FOPper’s freshman year. 
As I mentioned earlier, the most central aspect of a FOP trip, in my opinion, is the creation of a group dynamic based on equality and teamwork. From what I can tell, this theoretical FOP trip lacks a tightly knit community feel, evidenced in the developing relationships between certain FOPpers that excludes others. For example, Lizzie and Matilda appear to be forming a strong bond, but leaving Renee out in the process. Furthermore, Phillip only wants to spend time with Peter instead of with his peers. A few simple preventative solutions could be taken here to expand the horizons of the FOPpers and create a sense of unity. First off, initial orientation exercises at the start of the trip would have been extremely influential in forging friendships between all the FOPpers. Since this window of opportunity has passed, I would remedy the current situation by assigning random hiking orders during the day, such as to line up by birthday, favorite color, or height. This way, FOPpers who might not normally associate, such as Peter and Kelly, are brought together and given the chance to get to know each other. Ideally, the FOPpers can create their own conversations, but if there is a lack of discussion (or Renee still feels rejected because Lizzie and Matilda continue to reminisce about their worldly travels), as a FOP leader I would propose certain trail games or conversation topics such as “describe your hometown” or “talk about your pets” to spark conversation. 
Another factor that can contribute to FOP group division is competition, which Peter has initiated by creating a race to set up the tarps. Friendly competition can add excitement to a FOP trip, but it must be approached with hesitation. Since this group is already exhibiting early signs of rifting, I would refrain from any sort of competition until everyone is getting along equally. 
The third concern I have involves Kelly. Even though she insists she is alright, the combination of shivering and under eating is definitely a red flag alert while on the trail. Considering this is only day three of the FOP trip, I would be watchful that she is adequately warm, well rested, properly hydrated, and getting enough to eat everyday so conditions do not deteriorate. If gentle assistance does not ameliorate the situation, my co-leader and I may have to address our concern with her directly.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[Since last year, I feel that I’ve learned how to better help others using my experiences at Harvard. I am currently a mentor at The Harvard Crimson, which involves helping a freshman through an intensive, semester-long comp process. My student was an international student from Turkey, in the US for the first time in her life. I thought that connecting with her would be difficult, but I found that she faced similar challenges as I had freshman year in balancing work, activities, and life. Using what I’d learned in the year since, I feel that I made a meaningful impact on her experience at Harvard thus far. Additionally, I’ve grown in teaching ability; last semester, I chose to teach a level of Chiantown ESL that required more Chinese fluency. Along with a co-tutor new to teaching English, I worked through the challenges of communicating lessons to 40 elders each week, teaching me the value of not only planning and communicating with my partner, but also responding to situations in the classroom on the fly. Overall, I feel much more comfortable about my place at Harvard, something I think will help me tremendously as a FOP leader.]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I love meeting new people, but there’s something special about getting to know freshmen. They’re in a completely new environment, learning at every moment, and so I think that my approachability would be one of my strengths as a FOP leader. I know from my experience as a FOPper and a freshmen that being able to ask older people about anything is the key to making myself more aware and more comfortable in my surroundings. Being personable and genuine facilitates this kind of relationship and interaction, and I feel that I can bring this to the table as a FOP leader.

Furthermore, I’ve experienced moving to a new school firsthand many times before. Even before Harvard, I attended five schools in six years, giving me a wealth of experiences to share with others. FOP is a transition period for first-years, and I think that my ability to speak to many difficulties caused by being somewhere new – from not knowing anyone to adjusting to a new climate - would be my biggest strength in connecting with and leading first-years.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[
My greatest challenge in leading first-years would probably be balancing the leader’s responsibility of handling logistics with constantly assessing the dynamics of the group and responding as needed. Although this is fairly broad and probably a concern of most FOP leaders, I think that I could become preoccupied with one and simply  “delegate” the other to my co-leader, whereas the two leaders should work together to achieve both. Additionally, I think FOP leaders need to maintain a certain level of authority, and I think it would be a challenge for me to balance that role with being friendly and getting to know the first-years in a way a friend would. 
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Cross country my senior year was fairly disastrous on several levels. After being injured the majority of the summer, I knew my results would be mediocre, but I hadn't expected to be so physically and mentally drained. I dreaded practice, and even races didn’t bring me the same excitement as before. My classes senior year were also much more difficult than I had anticipated, and I was became frustrated by my inability to balance my schedule. My coach and my parents wanted me to “stick it out” for just one more semester, though, and I agreed with them. I was, and still am, a runner. My pride was at stake if I ever quit.

At the same time, though, I began to realize that cross country affected not only my health, but my well-being too. I was placing the needs of others above my own, and as a result I doubted myself at every turn. It took some time, but after a while it clicked. Running doesn’t have to be in a competitive, “need-to-win” environment for me to enjoy it. It hurt tremendously to approach my coach and inform him of my decision to leave varsity, and in hindsight I think wish I could have reconsidered my other extracurricular activities as well, if only to adjust my schedule to allow more time for cross country. Regardless, I know now that I’m still a runner because I want to be.  
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Amongst everything that’s happening, my first concern is Renee’s apparent discomfort with Lizzie and Matilda’s conversation. Every FOPper should feel comfortable in their environment, but this situation arising also indicates that there hasn’t been a conversation about what the first-years are most concerned about going into Harvard. A leader-led, anonymous question-session could address Renee’s and the rest of the trip’s concerns about “old money” or not fitting in with these types of conversations. Addressing these issues doesn’t necessarily dispel the possibility of Lizzie and Matilda finding common ground on their expensive vacations, but will hopefully bring up topics that most of the first-years will be able to discuss together –from classes to Annenberg. For the time being, though, I think it would be wise to have a leader initiate conversation with Renee and another first-year, to maybe find common ground that will show her the similarities she shares with others beyond Lizzie and Matilda.

In the same vein, Phillip’s boasts and unresponsiveness to Daniel is clearly creating discomfort not only with the first-years but also with Peter, a dynamic that is definitely not ideal. I do think that the anonymous questions would also be helpful in this situation, since Phillip may then realize that despite his perceived maturity and confidence, he actually has much in common with the other first-years. Additionally, I think it would worthwhile for the leaders to discuss their most valuable experiences at Harvard thus far, thus showing the first-years that the most important aspects of college are often the relationships you form and the people you meet, not how often you party or travel to other countries.

Finally, Kelly’s behavior may be a result of a shyer personality, but I think the shivering and the willingness to give away food is extremely concerning. In the best scenario, she has a tendency to be cold and actually does get full extremely easily, but it could easily be indicators of an eating disorder. In any case, this situation is definitely best addressed in a personal conversation between one leader and Kelly, and with the intention of making sure she’s healthy and getting enough energy to withstand the physically-intensive nature of FOP.

-I go day hiking with my family a lot 

I love being in nature because it’s so beautiful, and it appeared there all on its own. The outdoors is this relaxed, calm, peaceful place where you can just focus on those you are with and the trees around you. I’d love to gain more outdoors skills because when I’m older I hope to and plan on making the outdoors a bigger part of my life. It’s so amazing to be in the wilderness that I’d like to have the skills needed to protect others and myself during a long trip.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[My strengths would come from my self-reflection, motherly complex and Canadian-ness. 

I do a lot of self-reflection, and want to talk with incoming freshmen about what I’ve been thinking about and my experiences so far. Things like transitioning from the high school mentality of wanting to get into a good college, to a college mindset of figuring out the person you want to become, and how to go about doing that: what I’ve done and what has worked. Also, I want to share with them how I dealt with challenges I had with my roommate (see below). 

I’d also love to just hear their stories, and develop a close bond with them that lasts the three years we’re here together and beyond that. My motherly complex makes me want to take care of others and be someone they can go to at any time.  

Also, I hope to spread around a bit more Canadian-ness. It’s easy to enter the bubble of stress many people here are in, but it’s so important to remember the wonder we felt when we found out we were accepted to this place, and let that wonder stay with us for these four years. I work at the Harvard Shop where I meet people who’ve travelled for days just to come see this place where we live and go to school. It’s so amazing to be here, and I want to let freshmen keep that in mind as they begin their four years. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My challenges would probably be staying patient in the process of friendship formation, and constantly being my best self for six days. 

Patience would be one of my challenges, since I would want everyone to become best friends from the beginning, and would need to learn to let the process play itself out gradually. I come from a relatively small high school where I knew everyone really well, so I remember the first month at Harvard took some adjusting: firstly, not knowing every single person, and secondly, not being able to form immediate and meaningful bonds like I had on FOP and had been surrounded with for the past four years. In this vein, I’d need to learn the balance of how to make sure the incoming freshmen become friends with each other first, while in parallel becoming friends with my co-leader(s) and me.  

Also, it could be a challenge to be my best self for six days for the FOPpers regardless of any stress or exhaustion, especially in the first day or two when we’re still figuring things out: seeing how FOPpers are getting along, not sure how things exactly will play out in the next few days but looking confident for the FOPpers and like we know exactly what we’re doing. However, it definitely helps that summer will have just ended and school about to begin, and there will be these 10 days to devote all my attention to FOP and this group of incoming freshmen. 
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[In early November, there were two weeks where I was really worried about my roommate, since she’d often say things like, “I didn’t even want to come to Harvard”, and spend lots of time in our room inactive. Some recent events in her personal life had understandably gotten her down. However, I wasn’t sure if it was to a point where I should be seeking help for her, because she kept saying nothing was wrong. And she’s resilient: she’d take critique from the Lampoon head-on for weeks and simply use it to improve her writing.   

I wanted to do something since it was so sad seeing her like this, but also wanted to respect her repeated assurances of being okay. I decided we were at a place in our relationship where she’d feel comfortable reaching out to me if need be. The unfortunate events had happened, so intervening might only reinforce their presence and the fact that others were also paying attention to them; instead of letting my roommate move past them at her own pace. Also, the events were significant enough that she would make sure they wouldn’t happen again. I thought part of her feeling down might also be homesickness, because she was calling her family a lot, so Thanksgiving Break might let her refresh. In the end, I decided to wait things out, and in the meantime gently make sure she knew she could come talk whenever she needed to. 

Thankfully, she got back up shortly after!
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My three main concerns are Peter’s attitude, Renee’s position and Kelly’s. 

Peter’s attitude is a big concern since it affects all the FOPpers. Maybe he has something on his mind, or is genuinely frustrated for example that Phillip isn’t bonding with the other freshmen as we’d like him to. However, the way he’s acting isn’t going to let us achieve the sort of atmosphere we want to create for these nine incoming freshmen. I would be honest with him. I’d let Peter know that I’m worried about him because of his attitude, and ask him if something is bothering him. Presumably we’d be comfortable enough with each other to have an honest discussion and talk it through until we both felt confident that things were resolved. I’d gently remind him of why he wanted to lead FOP in the first place, and reemphasize my hopes of making these next few days the best they can possibly be as an introduction to Harvard for our FOPpers. 

The way Renee’s FOP experience is turning out is not okay, and especially cannot be the precedent to her freshman fall. Her closing up is worrisome not only for FOP but also for how she might react to many cool people she meets at Harvard. Lizzie and Matilda might not be neglecting Renee intentionally but just be really excited to have met each other. Before trying to talk to them alone, the next morning I’d let the whole group know how happy I am that some of them are getting along so well, and gently suggest that they should get to know others they haven’t gotten the chance to yet. Hopefully though, a ‘clique’-like situation like Lizzie and Matilda’s wouldn’t happen in the first place because Peter and I would have the FOPpers hike with someone different each half-day. 

I’m worried about Kelly because it seems like she isn’t asking for help when she needs it, which is really concerning for her health and her enjoyment of FOP. She seems like such a sweet, gentle girl who sacrifices her needs for others, so I’d try to create an atmosphere where she’s at least more open about for example, being cold. As we’re hiking, Peter and I would frequently offer to stop for water/layer-changing/bathroom breaks, and respond to FOPpers’ requests in a way that lets them know they should feel absolutely comfortable speaking up. If the problem persists I might bring Kelly aside and let her know honestly about my worries, since I’ve seen her shivering, etc. 

Though not as pressing, I’d keep an eye on the others. Daniel is trying to impress Phillip, and if Peter changes his attitude (constantly switching places in the hiking line), Phillip and Daniel might start to bond. Suzy seems attracted to Mark, but if they are respectful enough of FOP rules they don’t pose an immediate problem. Also, Jack does not seem to be in as worrisome a place as Kelly; he might be taking time to open up.

I am generally easy going and enthusiastic, but also know when it is time to get serious in order to complete a task. I work well under high-pressure situations because I am resourceful.  My best asset is my willingness to learn and general openness to new experiences. These two qualities are reflected in both my work and in the way I interact with others. I do not shy away from hard work or acquiring new skills. I am a dependable, easy-going, and a good team player. Most of all, I love meeting and talking to new people. I hope I get the chance to work with incoming freshman—I’d love to be able to talk to them about their hopes for college or fears of living away from home and they would be able to come to be about anything.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My greatest challenge would be my lack of actual hiking experience. I just know that I would love to lead fop and perhaps my lack of experience would be a positive attribute, especially since there are a wide range of students participating and they may not be in peak physical condition, and I would be able to make them feel more comfortable with that fact and not like they were in the back of the pack, so to say. They say that amateurs often hold the best advice because they are in the process of “figuring things out” along with other novices. I believe that having a weakness will make me more accessible and relatable to the students. I know that as an underclassman I have often viewed older students as somewhat untouchable and hard to approach, but when they showed a weakness it made them seem much more relatable. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One of the most difficult decisions I’ve continually had to make is whether to go out with friends or to do what I came to Harvard to do: study. It is usually an internal monologue that culminates with me ruminating on the pros and cons of a real ‘typical college’ experience versus good grades. The most important factor I always consider is my happiness. When I think back on my college years, will I remember that A I received on a 10 page paper I spent ages on, or will I remember the fun experiences with new friends? The problem with factoring happiness is that it exists in two dimensions; it has both intensity (how happy or sad I feel in the moment) and a temporal component (how happy I will feel later). The factor I wish I considered more was my stress levels now that finals are approaching and I am scrambling to do well in all my classes. 
	For example, last weekend, I had a 10 page paper on Joyce’s Ulysses and instead of finishing it so that I would have two days to revise the essay, I instead went out to a party with friends. We came back home late and proceeded to watch comedies until four in the morning. Even though I knew what the “responsible thing” to do was, I opted for the fun choice. I then regretted this on Monday night when I had to sacrifice sleep to extensively revise my paper. That being said, I think I am a typical freshman in every way possible with regard to balancing harder schoolwork and nascent friendships, but that I am slowly figuring it out. 
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[I would triage the situation similarly to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. My concerns would first be general health and safety of the Foppers, their psychological health and relationship building, and finally focusing on that mysterious bonding quality that FOP ensures. 
	My first priority would be making sure Kelly and Jack are doing okay by talking to them. Kelly seems not to be properly fed or clothed. During WOOP, the way my leaders gauged our opinions on controversial topics (health, safety, fatigue) was by having us close our eyes and taking a random poll. If she did not respond to that, I would approach her individually. Basic needs like food, warmth, health and safety are most important. 
	Next, I would try and tackle the psychosocial dynamics of the relationships forming. Ideally, after FOP, every freshman should feel that they grew closer to their group members, and often this is what happens in practice. In this case, I would probably try and rearrange the partnerships that have formed so that people do not just talk to one person.  Something I would stress is that everyone have an equal workload (i.e. carrying the same weight of equipment)—inequality would not be tolerated. Mark has assumed too much responsibility and Suzy seems to be using him so I might put Suzy with either Matilda or Lizzie. While Philip may feel more mature, he is still just a freshman and would encourage him mingling with the other Foppers, like Daniel. 
In general, I think the bonding could be accomplished by putting the foppers in pairs and having them ask each other “getting to know you” questions. To start off, maybe questions about general interests or hometowns. Then, rearranging them so that they each get to talk to each other, not just one other person (i.e. the Lizzie-Matilda relationship). The point of fop is not homogeneity, but rather bonding with others unlike yourself and maybe even gaining some life perspective. Over the course of few days, I might ask them more probing questions like “What do you hope to get out of your freshman year?” or “What are you most excited/worried about in college?”
	Finally, I would address try and bring to the group what FOP is all about: FUN! Especially if we have five miles of strenuous hiking ahead of us the next day, I would try and make the meal the night before engaging. On WOOP, before meals we would make up some sort of complicated hand gesture routine and scream something at the top of our lungs. We asked our leaders questions and ruminated on life. There is something about sharing a meal in darkness that is most conducive to conversation, I’ve found. In addition, our fop leaders sang us songs they knew like “Deepest Africa”. I would reconvene with my co-leader, Peter, and try to organize something similar wherein we teach the foppers songs we know or share stories. We would go around telling stories or jokes, maybe singing songs and being ridiculous.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[Summer 2013 - Hiking with my parents through local trials. To get ready for FOP (and break in my boots), I participated in short day trips with my family through local Florida trails. 

Fall 2013 - FOP! I had the great fortune of participating on a switch trip. I participated in the typical ways a FOPer does: carrying supplies, setting up camp, cooking, etc.

Fall 2013 - Kayaking down the Charles. I learned how to kayak on a Through the Gates trip. I was an eager participant, inspired by my awesome experience on FOP.

Outside of FOP, I don't have too much outdoors experience, but I am eager to learn more. I am extremely passionate about the program, and I want to make sure that our incoming freshman have the same amazing experience that I had.
]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2>11th grade - joined the Operations Team for my high school marching band. On operations, I was responsible for transporting materials, including podiums, microphones, water, etc., to and from rehearsal. Operations required me to arrive an hour early and stay an hour late to an already long rehearsal, but it taught me how to be responsible and accountable for others.

11th grade - became a tuba section leader for marching band. As section leader, I was responsible for making sure my section was performing well, both musically and visually. This required multiple extra section rehearsals after school, in which I would lead the section through music practice and marching training. Playing tuba also taught me the importance of shoulder strength, which I learned really comes in handy for backpacking.

12 grade - elected as president of National Honors Society. Being president of NHS taught me how to deal with crises and govern with efficiency. NHS was made up of about 400 students, and when I came into presidency, it was extremely unorganized and stressful. My fellow officers and I had to implement new systems, like a point system and a new tutoring system, to run the program more efficiently. We were also able to establish entirely new opportunities for students, like a program that had our NHS students become friends with students in the special-ed program at my school.

12 grade  - became a tutor at my high school. After school every day, I would hold free tutoring sessions in my school's library for any student that needed some extra help. At first, I found tutoring extremely difficult, but over time I learned how to make people understand foreign concepts, through breaking down processes step by step.

12 grade - mock trial attorney. My school for the first time started a mock trial team, and I decided to sign up as an attorney for the team. I've done a lot of extracirriculars, but I felt much more responsibility in this instance. Since this was the first year of the club, and since there were not very many people, the survival of the group depended on everyone playing multiple roles and preparing their parts, even though nobody had any experience with mock trial. We had a bit of a bumpy start, but in the end mock trial taught me how to be a responsible teammate.

		<Q7.1>1</Q7.1>
		<Q7.2>	Throughout my high school and college experience so far, I have enjoyed taking on leadership roles, and it has always felt natural transitioning into these positions. I think my greatest strength as a leader is that I believe the key to being a good leader is quite simple: respect. To me, treating people with respect is about following the golden rule, which is the primary principle I strive towards in life.  This principle comes naturally for me because I genuinely like people. Liking people and treating others with respect, I have found, is a beautiful cycle. If you treat people with the respect they deserve, it brings out the best in them, which makes them likable. When you like someone, it is much easier to respect him or her. I like to lead through making deep connections and friendships, treating others like equals, not inferiors, which I think is a good mindset for leading new students.
	Another strength I feel I have is empathy. I still remember vividly coming to Harvard for the first time, being extremely nervous and unsure of myself. FOP gave me a great group of friends and confidence in myself. Going through that transformative experience is what makes me want to lead FOP; I want others to have the same experience that I had. This feeling of empathy I have for incoming students gives me an enthusiasm for the program that I hope will rub off on others.
</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>	Through my leadership experiences from the past, I feel confident in my ability to gain respect and make deep connections with people. I think the bigger challenge for me will be facilitating an environment that ensures that the students in the group are connecting with each other. While I can control my actions and the way I treat people, it is much more difficult to ensure that others are making connections and treating each other with respect. Although facilitating an environment of openness and respect will be a challenge, it is a challenge I am looking forward to facing. Watching my FOP leaders, Chris and Mary, create an environment of enthusiasm and respect was totally inspiring, and I want to replicate that kind of environment. I feel that if I exude enthusiasm with my actions, and facilitate meaningful group interactions, I can overcome this challenge.
	I think another challenge I might have is getting students reluctant to interact and "buy" into the FOP experience, whether it be because of shyness or a negative attitude, to open up and make connections. Thankfully, I was fortunate enough to have a FOP group that all completely bought into the experience right away, but I am sure there are students that feel uncomfortable or unwilling to participate at first. I feel that one of my biggest strengths is my sense of humor, and I plan to use humor and respect to draw people out and foster a positive group dynamic.
</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>	One of my greatest passions in life is music, a passion that started in 5th grade when I started to play euphonium, a low brass instrument. Throughout elementary school and middle school, I became accomplished at playing the instrument, auditioning for and making the Florida All State Band in seventh and eighth grade. In ninth grade, while I was still performing at a high level, I started to hit roadblocks with my development. I discovered that there were certain areas in which I needed major work, particularly my range. Success on euphonium up until that point had always come naturally, so when my struggles on the instrument first began, it took an extreme toll on my confidence. The situation was made even worse by the fact that I was a freshman starting at a new school, meaning that I was already under a great deal of stress. Thus, I faced my toughest decision yet: do I keep playing euphonium, or do I quit and try something else? At the time, the anxiety I was feeling was a major factor, and I felt that trying something different could relieve me of stress. Thankfully, my peers helped me consider the long-term factor, that I could possibly work through my struggles and continue to be successful. In the end, I decided to continue playing euphonium. It took hours of practice, but I eventually was able to work through my issues on the instrument, and I continue to have success to this day. </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5>Obviously, there are personal issues within the group that need to be addressed. However, first and foremost, the issue of safety is the most concerning. I want everyone to have a good time on FOP, of course, but the most important issue is that everyone is safe and physically able to keep hiking. First, there is the issue of Peter taking us down the wrong trail. It is apparent that Peter and I need to more carefully plan our route. We need to meet together and make sure we carefully follow our map. Perhaps I should be the one leading the group if Peter struggles with navigation. Another issue concerns Mark. I am worried about Mark taking so much more weight than everyone else. I need to watch him pack his bag carefully the next time we leave, to make sure he does not carry too much weight. Another possible red flag I noticed with regard to safety concerns Kelly. Even though she claims to be ok, her shivering and giving up of food are a concern. It would be good for Peter and I to meet with her alone and allow her to voice any concerns she has, and to encourage her to eat as much as she needs; we can always get more food if we need it. In addition, Peter and I must make sure we debrief the students about the dangers of Gage Caves; we cannot have anyone putting him or herself in danger.
	After safety issues, my second concern is that that the quieter FOPers are having a good time and feel comfortable with the group. Being a quiet person is fine, but sometimes it can indicate discomfort. To make sure these FOPers, particularly Kelly, Jack, and Renee, feel comfortable, I can make sure to engage them frequently in conversation. I want to gauge how they feel about the trip, and about school in general. A good way to get them to interact with the group is through the use of games. Even though games like "G'day Bob," are silly, I remember on my FOP trip games like this made everybody comfortable interacting and having fun with each other, which was the first step in forming strong bonds.
	My third concern is that certain members of the group may be alienating other members. I feel like it is hard for Renee to interact with Lizzie and Matilda, and for everyone except for Peter and me to interact with Phillip. To alleviate this situation, I want to utilize our nights reflecting on our hopes, dreams, and concerns for the future. My FOP group was incredibly diverse, but through reflection we found that we all had much to learn from each other, and so much in common concerning our hopes and fears about entering Harvard. I think giving people the opportunity to open up will allow Phillip to feel closer to everyone around him, and allow Renee to feel a closer connection to Lizzie and Matilda again.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I’d say my enthusiasm and occasional sassiness would be useful in pumping the kids up, not only for the trip, but also for the friendships and experiences they have to look forward to in the coming months! I don’t feel awkward at all interacting with new people—adults, kids, freshmen, all of the above. I forgot to write this earlier in my leadership experience, but I was also a member of my school’s Peer Support group, which was primarily in charge of welcoming and “buddying up” new kids in the school community. So I have the social part covered. I am also comfortable making decisions for large groups, as it was something I did quite often in positions of leadership in high school. I’d also say I’m fairly patient in describing processes and lessons to others. With that said, I could definitely use a refresher course in pitching tents/lighting stoves etc. As for the actual hiking part, Singapore may not have groomed me to be the ultimate outdoorswoman, but I appreciate the beauty and company of hiking/camping in a group and would love to see a little more of what New England nature has to offer with these kids.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[Like I mentioned before, I am no Bear Grylls. With that said, I’m all about learning new things, especially ones that will help me appreciate the FOP experience. I have been in charge of large groups before but usually in environments with which I have had previous experience. Working with a co-leader will make this a little easier, I’m sure, but before I lead any trip, I would just want to be sure I was properly equipped, physically and mentally, with appropriate resources in case any unexpected obstacles were encountered. I’m all about preparation… and adaptation, if needed.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I knew things were going to get rough when photos of two of my volleyball teammates, with a couple of beers in their hands, surfaced on Facebook. At the time, we had been under strict athletic contracts, banning consumption of alcohol during the season. Eventually, the photos reached the high school administration, our coaches and the hallways. As both a member of the volleyball team and editor-in-chief of the newspaper, I had a conflict of interests. My journalistic obligation was to cover the story because it was relevant: it concerned student-athletes, administrators and violation of school policy. However, I could not help but worry the coverage would hurt my relationship with the team, since my coach had made it clear that neither she nor the players wanted the story printed. But after consulting the managing editors and our sponsor, I decided that, considering the nature of the story—concerning images in the public domain and a breach of school policy—it needed to be published. We made sure the reporter who covered the story had no ties to the involved parties and withheld names, teams and punishments from publication. The final story was less than 200 words and ironically gave the athletes more anonymity than the Facebook photos had. Ultimately, I’m satisfied that I was able to preserve the newspaper’s integrity and reconcile them with my interests as student-athlete.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[There is obvious observable tension between some members of the group. While all deserve attention, perhaps those which require more immediate or urgent responses would be the following:

•	From the sound of things, Daniel seems to be seeking some sort of recognition from Phillip. Gaging self-worth based on one’s interactions with others leaves the individual susceptible to acting stupidly, like “get[ting] trashed” back at school, in order to impress a peer. Suppose Daniel gets impatient or frustrated with Phillip’s disinterest in his stories and decides to venture off to the “dangerous” caves, which your co-leader explicitly labels as off limits? That obviously puts him in danger. We might also be suspicious of Daniel acting similarly dangerously back on campus with peers, another thought for future concern. On the flipside, Phillip—explorer extraordinaire— might initiate the late-night trip to the caves, a proposal to which we would expect Daniel, given his susceptibility to peer pressure, might yield. With this said, I would not accuse Daniel of any of this in person. Rather, I would try to talk to him and divert some of his attention away from always trying to impress Phillip and be his puppy dog.
•	While I understand some people are just quiet by nature, I would be more concerned about helping characters like Renee, Kelly and Jack feel comfortable. Just because kids are vocal does not mean they are “fine,” even though it may be an indicator that they require less attention than others. In this instance, however, it might be better not to single them out and ask them if they are okay because that might come across as embarrassing or nagging after a while. Rather, I would try to incorporate more group activities and games into the agenda so these people feel included without necessarily having to take the spotlight. With particular note on Kelly, I would just be extra wary if she lacks energy during the rest of the activities or falls behind.
•	Another note about communication: communication with Peter. Perhaps one of the most crucial issues that should be addressed is my relationship with Peter. I'd talk to him. The wrong-route and thunderstorm escapades might have frustrated him, so this would just be a check in to see where he is mentally. Also it is important that the co-leaders have a united front in front of the FOPpers, so I would want to square away our plans for the rest of the evening’s activities and the following day’s route. I might also want to address his eye rolling at Phillip and double check if he has any issues he wants to talk about. Leading the team is a team effort, so it follows that we should be on the same page about everything.

		<Q6.1>Summers 2011, 2012: 5 different backpacking trips, each 3 days with a group of 8-10 campers in Rhode Island. Focused on environmental education and backpacking skills. I was a co-leader responsible for organizing food, cooking, teaching, and planning hike activities. 

Summer 2012: 5 day camping trip in Arizona, Grand Canyon area. Went with family, I was responsible for food setup as well as camp setup. 

Summer 2011: 10 day backpacking and biking trip throughout Cape Cod, Nantucket, and MV. I was a participant in a group of about 10 members. Trip focused on group building and leadership training. 

FOP 2012:  Participant of FOP 13 with Riley Brian and Lizzie Thompson. Throughout the week I felt I developed a lot on my backcountry hard skills as well as understanding of the role of FOP leader in the group and larger Harvard community.

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Summers 2010-2012: Summer Camp Counselor — I worked at a camp where I was responsible for campers, I spent my time teaching outdoor skills, environmental stewardship and group building activities and games.

Sophomore Junior Senior years of HS: YMCA Community Leader — I was a Leader at my local YMCA. Responsibilities include volunteer work at the afterschool program where I led group games and activities. I also worked with students my own age directing the junior counselor program. 

Junior Senior years of HS: Peer Tutor — Met weekly with several students my own age, worked with them on their homework, study skills, and served as an all around peer mentor.

Freshman year at Harvard : Citizenship Tutor — I met weekly with a Harvard employee who was studying for his citizenship exam. I tutored him on all of the information he must know for the test. 

Freshman and Sophomore Year at Harvard — I am a tutor for a local high school junior student in English. I like to think that I serve as much more of a “big brother” role as I meet with him several times a week, often in informal settings, and I serve as a mentor for him.

		<Q6.3>Over the past year I have learned a lot about myself as well as what it means to be a FOP Leader. A lot of this growth has been a product of studying abroad this past summer, in which I was able to cultivate my own independence and confidence leading peers. Throughout the summer we went on several trips in which I felt I often assumed a logistics leadership role, especially on our hiking trip in Cinque Terre. I led the actual hike, and coordinated lodging and other logistics. I feel that this experience contributed tremendously to my own growth in that I was able to evolve as a peer leader rather than the camp counselor type role I felt I was more used to. In addition, for the past year I have been tutoring a local high school student. We have a great relationship and I have assumed much more of a peer mentor role than just a tutoring role. He is just close enough in age to me, and it is a relationship that I think would translate very well to a FOP type relationship in which I am providing support and guidance to someone very close to me in age. This role has allowed me to open up more as a mentor and to learn more about what it means to connect and cultivate these types of relationships. </Q6.3>

		<Q7.2>Throughout high school I worked as a summer camp counselor at an Environmental Education Camp. As a counselor, I was responsible for my own group of campers, typically aging from 12-14. I believe one of the greatest strengths I would bring as a FOP Leader would be my ability to identify the intricacies of a group dynamic and to lead effectively in response. I recognize that a FOP group will likely be diverse in many ways, and I strongly believe that the key to a successful and enriching experience lies in productively bringing everybody together to ensure that each participant is actively involved and feels welcome. To that end, one of my strengths is my ability to make people feel comfortable. I pride myself on my ability to bring a diverse group together, and to make that initial period of group development as easy as possible. This happens through my ability to open up to people and to create strong emotional bonds with ease. I also feel that my excitement for FOP will be a tremendous strength of mine. Maintaining energy and enthusiasm on the trail, especially when things may be tough, is a strength of mine. I strongly believe that positivity is contagious and is one of the keys to a successful group dynamic. FOP made a huge impact on my life and my life at Harvard, and I am so excited to have other first-years cultivate these friendships and have the incredible transition I did.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think that one aspect of leading FOP that may be challenging for me is the co-leader dynamic. I have led trips before in which I work with a co, however most of my experience leading has been with a Junior Counselor helping me. I really like the idea of having a co-leader, however something that might be initially difficult may be the separation of responsibilities and the role that we each will play for our Foppers. I remember on my FOP trip one leader often assumed a more serious “hard skills” role while the other was more involved in creating a comfortable group environment. It might be difficult for me at first to find my role in a co-leadership as I typically like to be involved in all aspects of the trip from cooking to group games to one-on-one conversations. Though I know this might be a weakness of mine, I recognize the immense thought and planning that is involved with a co-leader in the days leading up to the trip that can help this.  ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[When working with other people I try to be especially conscious of their needs. Senior year when I was volunteering on a YMCA wilderness retreat I began to notice that three of the participants were having a hard time. These participants, I’ll call them “Jack”, “Chris” and “Harry” were all 15. Both Jack and Harry appeared to strongly dislike one another, however they both insisted on spending every second with Chris. It got to the point where they were fighting for Chris’ attention. When it came to sleeping arrangements I felt I had to interject.
At this point Jack and Harry had already been spoken to about how aggressive they were being towards each other (harsh language, pushing) and I knew that I had to make sure the rest of the trip went smoothly. I felt I was faced with three options: I could split the three of them up, in which case Jack and Harry would each be upset. I could let one stay with Chris and put the other in a different group, in which case the one left out would be extremely upset. Or I could speak to the three about expectations, and let them all stay together.
After considering the outcome each I decided I would let them know the expectations and trust them to bunk together. It was a step for me as well as them in building trust, and I at the time I was hopeful they would be able to work it out. I recognize that part of growth and learning is trying and possibly failing, so I decided to put things in their hands. Although it did not work out perfectly, I think that at the time it was the option that allowed for growth among the three. I also think this allowed Jack and Harry to see how their behavior affected their friend. 
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The three troubling parts of this scenario are Kelly’s shivering and possible health/comfort issues, Renee and Jack becoming less involved with the group and possibly feeling put out, and Phillip being disinterested with being a part of the group. 
First and foremost Kelly’s shivering and the fact that she has been giving away some of her food is a real red flag to me. Part of ensuring a great trip is making sure that everybody on the trip is feeling healthy and is able to hike and participate. Any health or safety issues only distract from the experience. It seems that Kelly might be having some health issues where she may not be getting enough food to the point where she is uncomfortable and perhaps doesn’t realize the reason. If there is nothing on her health forms that would signal another cause, I would perhaps mention to the entire group the importance of staying hydrated and well fed, citing some information on our own exertion and how we need fuel. If I notice this does not help at all, I would discuss with my co what the best course would be, and which of us is more comfortable with a one-on-one discussion about keeping healthy. Obviously I would make sure that this chat happens in a safe environment, away from other Foppers, and in a way where Kelly feels most comfortable. 

Secondly, it seems that Renee and Jack are feeling a little bit distant from the group and are not as actively involved. Renee was getting along with the two other girls, but may be feeling left out because she hasn’t had a similar upbringing. Jack seems to have not made any strong connections yet. For this type of situation I would try to tailor group activities so that these two are especially involved. Maybe this means doing biographies, having them hike next to new people, or group games in which these members can get a chance to excel or breakout. If the separation continues I would be comfortable checking in with them to see how they are, if they are actually feeling separated, and if there is anything I could do. Another thing I might consider would be to talk with Matilda about how Renee may be feeling, and ask if she would make an effort to include her. This would depend on how receptive I feel Matilda would be to this. Similarly, it may be helpful to talk to Peter or one of the other males on the trip and ask for them to reach out to Jack and make an effort to get him involved. 

Finally it seems Phillip is feeling “too mature” to enjoy his other Foppers and create strong bonds with them. This is an issue I am sure comes up a lot on real FOP trips. At this point in the scenario Phillip has not been mean-spirited or actively detracted from the trip, but I still feel like he could get more out of it if he were a more involved member of the group. If I am unable to steer a relationship between Phillip and the group through group-building, I would be comfortable reaching out as a peer or someone who is “more mature” to talk about the FOP trip, his role in the group, and ways that he could get more out of the experience through more active participation. I pride myself on my ability to approach individuals one-on-one to make things as comfortable and casual as possible.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[-Every summer since 2002: sailing in both dinghies and larger boats on Buzzards Bay in Southeastern Massachusetts. I participated in New Bedford Yacht Club’s Sailing School program for six years, learning to sail and race in both Optis and 420s. Since stopping sailing school and racing, I still enjoy going out often for recreational sails. I have learned how to tie many useful knots through these experiences!

-August 2011: During a week staying in Bar Harbor with my family, my sister and I completed a number of day hikes in Acadia National Park, including climbing Cadillac and Sargent Mountains. I researched the routes we hiked and carried the maps as our navigator through the trails. We also spent a day rock climbing (through a local service) on the cliffs on the shoreline.

-August 2012: 2 week internship in the sculling program at Craftsbury Outdoor Center in Vermont. As an intern, in addition to cleaning rowing shells and checking their rigging, I assisted campers with launching and landing their boats, helped campers when they wanted to take out canoes, and I learned a number of methods for tying down and securing boats. I also got to take advantage of Great Lake Hosmer for rowing and the wide range of cross-country trails for running and hiking.

-August 2013: FOP 13, 6 day Backpacking C trip on the Appalachian Trail in New Hampshire and Maine. I was a FOPper on the trip, and loved every part of it! My favorite moments were traversing the Mahoosuc Notch of the Appalachian Trail and summiting five (small) peaks in one day.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think my greatest strength in the context of FOP is that I am extremely comfortable leading and organizing in small to medium sized groups. FOP groups are the perfect size because they are large enough that there is diversity with respect to backgrounds and types of people, but small enough that you can effectively communicate needs and concerns and get to know everyone well. In high school, the student council I worked with was about 16 people (so only a little larger than FOP), and I thrived in a group of this size in that I knew all of the other members very well and we were able to effectively collaborate and get everyone’s input when making decisions. In a FOP group, the dynamic should be similar, and I especially love the one-on-one and small group interactions. I would be eager to share my thoughts and experiences from Harvard with my FOPpers to answer their questions.
	Another strength that would lend well to FOP is that I love teaching. Both as a camp counselor and as a peer tutor in high school, I found the experience of teaching new concepts extremely rewarding. I think that teaching in small groups is also an effective means to get to know people better, and it helps me to have a better understanding of the concept I am teaching.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[	The biggest challenge in leading a group of FOPpers would be being in-tune to the emotional and physical state of each member of my group, especially the members who might be quieter and more introverted. Obviously you do not want to seem overbearing or pushy, so constantly asking the quieter members how they’re doing may come across as annoying and make them talk even less. Therefore, you must be able to read their body language and follow their subtle actions to tell how they are doing. Then, if you perceive something is wrong, you must approach it carefully, so as not to seem like you are trying to baby the FOPper or make it seem like they aren’t responsible to handle problems on their own.
	Another major challenge that is incredibly important to overcome is establishing a good line of communication with your co-leader. While each might have their own tendencies and demeanor, it is essential for leaders to communicate often and clearly about how they think the group is faring physically and emotionally, and that they both are on the same page with what they are communicating to our FOPers so that they do not get mixed signals from the group leaders. Periodic check-ins on the trail and absolute honesty would be essential in establishing a good relationship with my co-leader.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[	Camp Nonquitt, the day camp I worked at for three summers, is located within an affluent, gated summer community, and most of the campers are from the well-to-do families that rent or own the large beach houses in this neighborhood. Some campers, however, are from other parts of Dartmouth, MA, outside the gate, and therefore come from comfortable but not necessarily rich backgrounds. While the varying backgrounds of campers almost never leads to problems, I can remember one instance in my last summer working there, when I came upon three campers together, all of whom I knew well. Christian and Luke, both of whom lived within Nonquitt, were talking about how big their families’ sailboats were, and which type of sailboat was better. Connor, the son of a local schoolteacher in Dartmouth who helped to run the camp, and normally a jovial, social camper, was also with them, but he had become quiet and seemed uncomfortable. I felt that I should do something to address Connor’s exclusion due to Christian and Luke’s privileged conversation topic. I did not want to outspokenly tell Christian and Luke to stop this conversation, since both were young and unaware of why talking about yacht size might be exclusionary, and pointing it out would only have marginalized Connor further; the goal was to defuse the situation as casually as possible. I added to the conversation that “bigger boats aren’t necessarily better; just look at what happened to the Titanic” (10 year-olds appreciate bad jokes), and then asked what each of them had planned for the upcoming camp talent show. This worked in shifting the conversation, and Connor seemed happy and included again. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	In this situation, the concern I find most pressing is the safety and well being of the FOPpers. Obviously the Gage Caves are a concern, but everyone on the trip is smart and mature enough to stay away; still, I will make it clear to both groups during the tarp competition to not head in that direction. More worrying, however, are the emotional states and fatigue levels of everyone in the group. The long day of hiking, made even longer by a leader’s mistake and severe weather, probably has everyone very worn out and possibly even a little frustrated. A key goal for tonight is making sure that everyone is comfortable with how things are going, asking if anyone has any questions or concerns so far, and preparing the group for the five miles tomorrow; a good time to work through these topics is to bring them up during dinner. I think it is also an opportune time to bring out the “low” bag (an idea my FOP leaders skillfully utilized), in which there is some surprise treat or fun activity to bring up everyone’s spirits. 
The health of my FOPpers is another major concern, especially Kelly’s small appetite and apparent shivering. While she maintains an outwardly positive (if quiet) attitude, there is clearly something wrong. Tonight, I will quietly take her aside and ask, in a non-accusatory manner, if there are certain parts of the food she doesn’t like (leading to her reduced appetite) and see how she feels comfortable with how things are going so far.
Lastly, I am worried about the divisions that seem to be arising in the social dynamic of the group with respect to socioeconomic backgrounds, attitudes towards and experiences with drinking and partying, and self-perceived maturity. Even if they don’t mean it or realize it, Lizzie and Matilda’s conversation has become exclusionary of Renee because of their privileged backgrounds. Similarly, Daniel’s discussion of “getting trashed” might marginalize other FOPpers if they have never drank alcohol or are morally opposed to it but are keeping their beliefs to themselves for fear of being deemed “uncool.” Phillip seems to think he is above interacting and bonding with the other group members because he is too mature. Each of these divisions stands in the way of everyone having an inclusive, meaningful FOP experience. I will undertake a number of steps to make the entire group dynamic more inclusionary. First, for the tarp competition, I will talk with Peter about setting up the teams beforehand. Ideally, I will take Lizzie, Mark, Philip, Kelley, and Renee, and Peter will have Matilda, Suzy, Daniel, and Jack; with these teams, FOPpers will have a chance to interact with people that they might not spend as much time talking to on the trail during the day. During dinner, Peter and I will casually make clear that FOPpers should feel free to ask either of us about the social scene at Harvard and how alcohol might play a part, but that the group should be discouraged from conversations of boastful “war stories” about alcohol, since it may make some people uncomfortable. After dinner, we will play the “five minute autobiography” game, in which the each FOPper and leader has five minutes to discuss our backgrounds or interests in order to create an atmosphere of openness and honesty within the group, and break down any barriers that have arisen. My FOP group did this, and while I was hesitant to open up at first, everyone else’s honest and all-in approach spurred me on, and the activity brought us all closer and made each of us respect where others have come from, regardless of socioeconomic background. Lastly, tomorrow on the trail, I will try to foster discussion among the whole group of topics everyone can relate to, like our favorite books and movies, and have us play word games like contact and categories.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[In order to stay safe in the outdoors and maintain a positive group dynamic, it’s vital to be mature and decisive. I think that my experience with being the leader of various clubs as well as leading canoe trips has qualified me to make important decisions that will steer my trip in the right direction and keep everyone safe. 

These experiences, like leading my school’s environmental club to get our school eco-certified or leading canoe trips without a single injury or emergency evacuation, have made me very familiar with taking charge of a group and ensuring its success. At other times, it’s equally important to step back to let your co-leader or even a camper take initiative in order for them to learn. I am very easy-going, and always willing to let other people take the lead when appropriate. 

Although safety is key to any trip, it’s also important for it to be fun. I think that I bring a great deal of enthusiasm and fun activities to trips that make them an even more memorable experience. While teaching in Jamaica, I saw how the energy I brought to teaching could make the kids excited to learn, which I think translates well to ensuring that everyone on my trip enjoys FOP. As well, being a counselor of young children has left me with plenty of activities that I can easily facilitate which I think will be very helpful in leading a FOP trip. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[Despite having a lot of experience with the outdoors side of leading trips, I think that FOP has a different side to it than what I am used to. A lot of the trip is based in helping freshman to discover who they are and allowing them to connect with each other, which I think I would have trouble adjusting to initially. 

That being said, before I started to get involved at camp, I would never have thought that I could deal with the responsibility of leading trips. I was enthusiastic about learning more about it and taking that first initial risk, and before I knew it, I was extremely comfortable with the task. Similarly, although I do not have too much experience with facilitating more emotionally involved activities, I am eager to learn and willing to take the risk of trying. It’s important to broaden your perspectives, and I think learning this skill set will make me a better leader. 

Another challenge will be reconciling my own knowledge of camping with what I am instructed to do. Every organization has a different way of tripping, with a lot to offer to the others. I found that on FOP, although it was initially difficult to relearn certain practices, I really enjoyed finding out how others went about certain tasks. I was up front with my leaders that I was willing to try new practices, and by the end I think all of us had gained something from it.   
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Ten-year-old boys are not known to be very thoughtful about what they say, and my camper cabin was no exception. One of the boys in the cabin was overweight, and the other boys were taunting him about it. He seemed to shrug it off, but I decided to approach him about it alone, and he told me that the comments were upsetting him a lot, but that I couldn’t mention it to the others. Initially, I made the difficult decision of just focusing on him to respect his privacy, only speaking to him about how he felt and how he could deflect their comments. 

When the comments persisted and I could see that they were really bothering him, I made another tough choice to confront the issue directly and sat the whole cabin down to discuss it. In order to protect him, I focused mainly on how we could build a culture of respect rather than discussing exactly who said or did what. 

The boys responded to this remarkably well, and even though the change wasn’t immediate, I think it started the group down a better path. A factor that it may have been helpful to consider was access to my superiors for counseling, but it went well despite facing it alone. I examined factors like the gravity of the situation, which changed to become more serious, and his right to privacy. As the situation’s gravity became more important than his privacy, I decided to change my position.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Renee may be feeling alienated because of the difference between her childhood and those of the others. Harvard is an extremely diverse place, and I think that one of the challenges of FOP is to facilitate connections across this diversity. This is why Renee’s situation is particularly troubling, as rather than discussing and coming to terms with their differences, the group is excluding her and will never bond completely. Most importantly, Renee could finish FOP feeling more nervous about college than when she came.

Her situation reflects a lack of mature connection in the group, so I would try to facilitate more emotionally engaging activities. These could build up to culminate with an activity like Five Minute Bios during which each FOPper could open up and come closer to the others. This would also give people more context into other people’s lives, so Matilda and Lizzie could be more sensitive to Renee’s situation and even try to learn from it.

Mark and Suzy may be starting down the road to a relationship beyond friendship, which is an issue because it is exclusive, meaning the two of them could end up spending much of their time alone together. An important element of FOP is the bonding of the group as a whole, which would become difficult if it was fragmented into separate relationships.  

To deal with this issue, I would talk to both Mark and Suzy individually. Without being too forward, I would encourage them to try to spend equal amounts of time getting to know everyone on the trip. I would suggest that if they were thinking of having an exclusive relationship, to wait until after the trip, and I would explain the important group dynamics that hinge upon a group being cohesive as a whole.

Finally, I’m troubled by Kelly’s responses to interest in her health. On the surface, this presents a health risk, as she may not be taking care of herself. In the wilderness, becoming sick is much more serious because of a lack of immediate access to healthcare as well as its potential to adversely affect the entire group. On another level, this shows that Kelly does not feel comfortable expressing how she really feels or asking for help when she needs it, which could have broader implications for her participation in activities.

I would try to talk to Kelly one on one, as her unwillingness to ask for help may be a function of not being comfortable in front of the other FOPpers. This would allow me to find out what is really going on so that I am better able to deal with the situation. I would also try to make her feel like she can be completely comfortable expressing whatever she feels by doing similar activities to those discussed in Renee’s situation. 

Although these problems are difficult ones, they can all be handled by being attentive to one’s FOPpers and shaping group dynamics, which are actions at which I think I could excel.

		<Q6.1>I love the outdoors, and throughout my life I have spent many hours outside golfing, running, and playing soccer, baseball, basketball, and football. In August of 2013, I went on a FOP Level B Backpacking trip. Before this trip I had no backcountry experience, but I embarked on the trip enthusiastically and by the end I was setting up tarps, bear-bagging, and tying knots like a pro! </Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[2013-current: Co-Founder of POINTS ACT Prep, a company designed to teach students the material and skills necessary to do better on the ACT.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I have experience in small-group situations with goals similar to those of FOP. When I went on FOP, I was amazed to see how similar it was to my high school’s retreat program. At my Jesuit high school, all students went on retreats off campus each year (with the exception of freshman retreat, during which we would take over the school for a weekend). I led all but the sophomore retreat. Each retreat, a leader would have a small group of students, and would guide the students to participate in activities, ultimately leading them to open up and talk to their group about anything and everything. Many of the activities on these retreats were very similar to activities on FOP. From my experience leading retreats, I know how to get people to participate, open up, and enjoy an amazing experience.  My second strength is my personality. I am very personable and easy to relate with, and I work well with others. I am open to talking about anything, and I am very enthusiastic. I love leading groups, and when people in my group see my enthusiasm and total commitment to the program (like my high school retreats) they buy into the ideas more and more excited too. My third major strength is my level-headedness. Although I am very enthusiastic and act very excited a lot of the time, I always make careful decisions. It was this cool-headedness that allowed me to maintain order when I led retreats. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My greatest challenge would be the fact that I do not have that much experience in the outdoors. Pretty much the only experience that I have is the FOP trip that I went on. It would initially appear to be uncomfortable for me to lead students who may very well have more experience and be better at the things we are doing than I am. However, I overcame something similar when I was on the varsity golf team my senior year. Senior year was the first year I had made the varsity team, and I was the 6th man on the team, the lowest position. I was the only senior on the team, and was the worst person on the team, so it was hard initially for me to “lead” because they all had so much more experience than I did.  However, I led through effort, determination, and support, ultimately getting voted captain at the end of the year. It would be much the same with FOP for me. Before FOP, I would work as hard as possible to learn all the skills necessary to be as good as possible. Then, during FOP, I would lead by supporting my group, always being positive, and giving a 110% effort.  If there were any outdoors-related situations that arose that I did not have experience with, I would defer willingly to my partner, listening to advice from anyone with experience before making an informed decision.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Perhaps the hardest decision of my life was deciding whether to attend Harvard or Duke.  I was accepted to Harvard early, and I received the Robertson Scholarship to Duke (all fees paid for), which meant that combined with the Coca Cola Scholarship I received, I would have been paid to attend school at Duke.  The first thing I did upon hearing that I had been offered the Robertson scholarship in April was to talk to my parents, friends, teachers, and potential employers. I listened to their opinions, and compared them.  Then, I visited both Harvard and Duke, and had lengthy conversations with graduates and current students. I made table after table comparing the pros and cons of each and spent hours researching on the web. In all rankings, Harvard was superior to Duke, but the Robertson Scholarship program had an incredible network, and Robertson Scholars are at the top of Duke’s extracurricular and academic hierarchy. Plus, when I visited both schools, I liked Duke better. Money was also a huge issue, but Harvard’s financial aid made Harvard affordable. Finally, the night before my decision, I went for a walk alone to decide. I knew that I wanted the challenge of having to start from the bottom, not the top. I knew that the people that I would meet at Harvard would exceed my wildest expectations and change my life. I knew that Harvard would make be a better person. Overcoming my fears and insecurities, I chose correctly.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern would be the fracturing that appears to be occurring in the group and the lack of a group dynamic. FOP experiences are best when everyone is getting along and participating. By the end of the trip, everyone should be able to count everyone else on the trip as a friend. This sense of unity is a huge part of FOP that is missing in this group. There are several approaches I would take to bring the group closer together. After talking to Peter about my concerns, I would make the following changes. While on the trail, I would mandate rotations in position, making each person hike next to different people every hour or so. Next, I would make it a point to draw Kelly, Jack, and Renee each into conversations with me and one other person so I could start the conversation, get the two FOPpers talking, and then move on. Furthermore, I would lead the group in singing songs on the trail or playing games like Contact to relax everyone. At camp, I would play group games like Mafia.  These games are fun for all, and give everyone a chance to get involved. When sleeping at night, I would make sure that everyone alternates who they are sleeping with, because night is the time that deep conversations are held that cement life-long friendships. I might also plant the idea of having all the FOPpers sleep together one night. My FOP group of 8 all slept under one tarp one night while the 2 leaders slept under the other, and it was that night that we all truly bonded with each other. 

My second concern is Kelly shivering but insisting she is fine. Oftentimes, people are afraid of holding up the group or being the “weakest link” so they say they are fine when they really are not.  Kelly especially seems to be the kind of person who does not want to cause any problems because of how she gives away her treats. To address this problem, I would (after talking to Peter) make a general announcement to the group that night about the importance of taking care of oneself. I would also emphasize that people could come to Peter or me privately with any concerns. If I saw Kelly shivering again, I would insist on her putting on a jacket, helping her with her pack or whatever she needed to be able to get it. 

My third concern is Phillip acting superior.  Although it is important for leaders to have a good relationship with FOPpers, the ultimate goal is for the FOPpers to bond with each other.  I would talk to Peter about my observations and get his opinion. Then I would tell all the FOPpers to switch positions in the hiking line so that Peter and Phillip are not walking together.  I would put Phillip in the very middle of the line so he has to talk to other FOPpers.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[	I think my strengths leading a group of first-year students would be my enthusiasm, my hard-work, and my vulnerability.
	I’m a person who is enthusiastic about life. I try to always see the positives in life. One of my favorite singers, Macklemore, once said “I don’t control life, but I can control how I react to it,” and I’ve really tried to take that to heart. Bad things happen to everyone, but reacting positively makes it much easier. My FOP leader, Jason Hirschhorn, was one of the most positive people I know, and his positivity made the trip incredible! I believe I could do the same.
	Additionally, I’m a person who can put in the necessary work to complete any task. If there is something that I’m passionate about I will find a way to complete it. It doesn’t matter whether it’s taking on an extra backpack, finding the perfect bear-bag spot, or staying up late with my co-leader to plan for the next day. I will do my best to make FOP an enjoyable experience for my FOPpees. 
	Finally, I am confident enough to expose myself and be vulnerable to my FOPpees. This is important because FOP is a time of introspection as well as being vulnerable with people in your FOP group. Having a leader who is vulnerable sets the stage for everyone else to be vulnerable.

		<Q7.3><![CDATA[	My greatest challenges leading a group of FOPpees would be to make sure the group stays a group and doesn’t branch off into cliques and to make the trip as fun and exciting as my FOP leaders made it for me.
	The magic of my FOP trip came from the fact that our twelve FOPsters grew close as a group, and nobody was left out of this. Our FOP leaders, Jason and Audrey did an incredible job maintaining this through the activities they gave us and by including everyone, even the shyest people. While I believe that I could manage the inclusivity that they did, I believe that it is extremely difficult to do so. 
	Audrey and Jason were magical at making everyone feel included, but they also made every little mundane thing exciting. Whether it was being woken up early in the morning by our two leaders playing miniature tanks over us or coming back to camp after a reflective activity to find our camp infested with New England Night Crawlers (gummy worms) which could only be removed by us eating them. My leaders did a fantastic job making my experience joyful through and through despite any seemingly negative situations; I’d love to emulate that, but I believe that it would be very difficult to do so.

		<Q7.4><![CDATA[        My high school has an incredible program called the Gwinnett Student Leadership Team (GSLT) in which three juniors and three seniors from our school get to receive leadership training and also play a large role in leading the school. Because it is a great opportunity, the best and brightest in our school apply, but we can only take three new students each year.
	Being a part of the program I had to help select students twice, once junior year and once senior year. The junior year selection was straightforward, but the selection my senior year was contentious. We were torn between six really awesome people. There were several camps, each of which had a different group of three people which they thought would work best. The main factors I considered were their public speaking ability and their ability to convey complex ideas. These were important because the three chosen students have to bring back what they learn at GSLT and share it with students at our school through our school’s leadership team. My eyes were opened, however, when our principal mentioned how these students needed to have influence throughout the school, and some of my candidates didn’t have that. Eventually, after nearly a week of fierce debates and concessions made on everyone’s part, our team agreed on a group of three students. Currently I couldn’t be happier with that group of people, even if only one of my original three were chosen.

		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	My three biggest concerns would be Peter’s questionable eye roll, Daniel’s desire to impress Phillip, and Renee’s apparent discomfort with her upbringing.
	Peter’s potential eye roll is a huge concern to me since the FOP leader sets the tone for the entire trip. The leader should be interested in fostering a safe place for FOPpees to be themselves and improving the lives of his/her FOPpees. Peter isn’t doing either of these things by simply rolling his eyes and passively growing annoyed with Phillip. This not only gives Phillip the false sense that his incessant talking about himself is OK, but can also tip other FOPsters off that their leader isn’t too interested in their own lives. I would react to this scenario by pulling Peter aside and letting him know that he should try to be genuinely interested in his FOPpees. Additionally, I’d tell him that this is a perfect teaching moment for him and Phillip. The ability to listen to others is a vital life skill, and one that Peter could teach Phillip while on FOP.
	I’m also concerned with Daniel’s desire to impress Phillip by acting cool. As mentioned previously, FOP is a place for first years to be themselves and discover who they really are. I feel that Daniel’s desire to interest Phillip has resulted in him not being himself and also missing out on meeting other people in his FOP group. A good way of fixing this could be to switch up the hiking order for a day; that way, Daniel would be able to talk with other people in FOP and discover not only who he is, but also how great everyone else in his group is. This would also allow Lizzie and Matilda to meet new people and develop more friendships. 
	Finally, I am concerned about Renee’s discomfort regarding other FOPpers well-off upbringing. It appears that Renee is ashamed about her upbringing, when it should be something to be proud of. Despite not having the opportunities that Lizzie and Matilda have had, she still has done incredible things in her life. She also needs to realize that she has a story, and that story offers a new perspective. It is even likely that her life is completely different from one that Lizzie and Matilda have ever imagined. I think that letting Renee know this is very important, not only to make her FOP experience awesome but her Harvard experience as well. At Harvard, there will be many people similar to Lizzie and Matilda, and Renee has to understand that she is unique and valuable. Letting her know this and switching up the usual hiking order will help Renee come out of her shell and be proud about her upbringing.
	While there are concerns regarding this FOP trip, all of them can be addressed. Peter can regain his appreciation for being a leader and a teacher, Daniel can discover who he is without having to act cool, and Renee can become proud to be herself. ]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2>On FOP I learned how to connect with new people on a deeper level, and how to have confidence in my bizarre sense of humor. I not only shared the weighty problems that rankle at my core, but also a lighter side of myself, a more humorous aspect. I realized that this quirky part of my personality, which I had previously only shared with close friends and family, was no less a part of my identity than my most serious concerns. When I returned to the yard, I found that those six days had completely changed how I related to new people; I was able to connect on a deeper level not only with my fellow FOPers, but also with the people I met post-FOP. If chosen to lead a FOP trip, I would try to expose my full personality, including my quirky side, to foster this special mode of sharing and listening, and help my FOPers carry this gift of communication back to Cambridge with them. As a FOP leader, I would try my best to create a fun and secure setting in which my FOPers would feel comfortable enough both to give openly of themselves and to love themselves. </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I consider myself something of an internal processor, and, as such, it often takes me some time to open myself up fully. FOP taught me how to share deeply about myself with new people, but it took a little while for me to do so. My FOP leaders were very open about themselves from the moment we met them, and their candor was important in creating a climate where we all felt comfortable talking about ourselves. I think I am rather easy to talk to, but, when I first meet people it can take a while for me to expose the profound issues that define who I am. Not every conversation on FOP needs to be, nor should be, a heart-felt baring of one’s soul. Nevertheless, these interactions are of the sort that distinguishes communication on FOP from the communication that many people experience during orientation week. If I were to become a FOP leader, I would make a large effort to reveal more of myself earlier in the trip, and encourage these more profound interactions among myself and others from the very beginning of FOP. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[When I was in seventh grade, I was walking with my mother when suddenly she collapsed on the sidewalk and cracked her head on the concrete. As I called 9-1-1, I felt as if I were watching someone else’s life unfold. The next morning, it became apparent to me that the hospital, which took in mainly convicts, although adequate for treating her condition, would not be the best place for her recovery. The doctors told me that she would most likely be able to recover in that facility, but that the best possible treatment was at a hospital that our insurance did not cover. My friend’s parents had founded this hospital, and could make arrangements for my mother’s treatment there with minimal cost to my family. I called my friend, and fortunately my mother was able to undergo the best possible treatment at this hospital. Having to ask my friend and her family to make the financial arrangements for my mother’s treatment was one of the hardest decisions of my life; it was probable that staying in the special facility would be beneficial to my mother, but I was told that it was not essential to her recovery either. I felt strange asking my friends’ parents for financial support, but in the end my mother’s safety utterly outweighed pride and financial concerns. I do not in the least regret asking my friend to help, but, in retrospect I wish that I had not thought twice before calling. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[One of my primary concerns would be Kelly shivering during breaks. Although this scenario suggests the possibility of many emotional tensions among the FOPers, physical safety must take priority. If I were the FOP leader in this scenario, I would ask Peter, my co-leader, to have a word with me in private. I would propose that instead of dividing the FOPers into two teams to set up the tarps, which might exacerbate divisions in the group, we instruct some of the FOPers to begin setting up the tarps, while the others begin cooking dinner. Meanwhile, with all of the FOPers thoroughly engaged in these activities, Peter and I would discretely ask Kelly to speak with us in private. We would ask her if she was warm enough, and make sure she put on more layers. That Kelly is giving away her desserts is not necessarily indicative of an eating disorder; desserts supplement an already sufficient caloric intake on the trip. I would keep an eye on Kelly and make sure that she is eating enough non-dessert food, though, and urge her to consume extra calories since she is feeling cold.

While conducting this private conference with Peter, I would bring up his attitude towards Philip. If Peter in his capacity as a FOP leader rolls his eyes at Philip, he sets an example of negativity that could poison the attitudes of everyone on the trip. At the same time, the trust and friendship between the co-leaders is equally integral to the success of the trip; just as a FOP leader can set an example of negativity, so can he set an example of harmony through a positive relationship with his co-leader. I would not want to approach Peter with an accusatory tone that might compromise our relationship. Instead, I would suggest to Peter that he make an effort to include Daniel in his conversations with Philip. This way, Daniel would feel included, Philip would not feel that Peter was being dismissive of him, and, by including Daniel, Peter would be distracted from his frustrations with Philip. I might also suggest that both Peter and I try to reign in our negative reactions to Philip. I would be sure to emphasize that both of us, not just Peter, were not reacting appropriately to Philip, so that Peter would not feel that I was blaming him. 

Renee’s apparent discomfort at Lizzy’s and Matilda’s discussion of their expensive hiking trip also warrants addressing as soon as possible; no FOPer should be made uncomfortable by socio-economic differences. At dinner, and later in the night, I would ask Peter that we be sure to lead the group in discussion about topics that veer away from travel and other activities that not all members of the group share in common. Instead, I would ask the FOPers about phenomena that they share in common, such as what their siblings and parents are like.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[Growing up, my family was extremely engaged in outdoor activities.  In addition, I was an active Boy Scout until just last year when I aged out of the program (18) after having obtained the rank of Eagle Scout.  So, it would be somewhat difficult to list every outdoor experience that I have had.  Over the years, I have hiked a sizable portion of the mountains of New England and Atlantic Canada and have gone on backpacking trips lasting anywhere from three days to three weeks.  I have camped in all weather conditions including during the cold Maine winter during February.  I am very familiar with both kayaking and canoeing because my family's house is situated on a lake and I therefore have ease of access.  In addition, I have participated in several whitewater canoe races and several week to two week long canoe trips.  My roles during these trips range anywhere from being a passive participant (when I was younger) to being the head organizer (now) in charge of final routes, executive decisions, and the first aid of others.  All of these experiences have granted me a close familiarity with the outdoors and nature, as well as procedures necessary to ensure a safe trip.]]></Q6.1>

		<Q7.2>In leading a FOP group, I feel my greatest strengths would be my outdoors experience, my first aid knowledge, and my familiarity with teaching outdoors skills and fostering a sense of group community.  As evidenced by my responses to previous questions, I am extremely comfortable in an outdoors environment, a confidence that I feel is necessary in individuals leading others on a trip.  As a Boy Scout, I spent many hours instructing individuals on outdoors strategies, skills and first-aid.  Such involvement in the BSA involved also working to foster a sense of community and companionship between the individuals with whom I am working.  This I feel is very similar to what is required of a FOP leader with regards to working to create relationships between your FOPers.  Finally, I work well under stressful conditions, so in the event that something needing immediate attention were to occur, I would feel comfortable dealing with it accordingly.  </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[In a leadership position, I can become slightly controlling and “type-A.”  I feel this is necessary to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those travelling under my direction.  So, as a FOP leader I feel my greatest challenge would be to step back occasionally so as to allow my potential FOPers to explore and discover what time in the woods has to offer.  However, I would be leading in concert with one or two other leaders and with this shared leadership dynamic, these effects would be minimized.  In addition, my leadership style has always been “lead by doing.”  For example, as a leader, instead of instructing individuals to set up the ridgeline, I would most likely be an active part of the process.  So, as a FOP leader, I would need to learn again to step back to a certain extent and allow the FOPers themselves to complete tasks, whereby serving as a resource.  ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[As a sophomore in high school, I along with another students started a nonprofit organization called Initiative: Eau.  Our mission is to provide the inhabitants of Burkina Faso, West Africa with access to potable and safe water, as well as initiate education programs concerning hygiene and sanitation.  The major way by which we raise capital is through our series of 5k road races entitled the Running Water Series.  This year has been a huge transformation for us as we officially incorporated this summer, we are in the process of becoming 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, and the number of races is expanding from 2 to 5.  So, with this come a significant number of difficult decisions.  One of them involves the hosting of a race in Somerville.  The plan was to hold the event in April to fast-track incoming funds.  However, recently we decided it would be best to hold off until the fall of 2014.  There were numerous factors contributing to this decision and involved a plethora of different areas of consideration.  The way we solved this dilemma however was through the use of a cost-benefit analysis approach.  We weighed the varying characteristics of both potential outcomes and in this way were able to reach a final decision to wait until the fall.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[          In examining this rather unfortunate series of events, the most pressing matters requiring attention are as follows: Gage Caves awareness, the fact that Kelly shivers during breaks, and the shifting dynamic of the relationships between Lizzie, Matilda, and Renee.  For me, the physical safety and wellbeing of my FOPers would take precedence over any social issues.  In the provided excerpt, it is mentioned that Peter “warns the FOPers to stay away from the dangerous Gage Caves, a quarter-mile to the northeast of the camp.”  This vague description of the locality of a hazardous region is problematic.  Once at the camp, I would potentially scope out the Gage Caves and their relation to the group’s setup.  Once having gathered information in this regard, I would be sure to discuss with the FOPers in which direction these landforms were found and also warn of their dangerous characteristics.  I would instruct them as to the proper direction in which to travel to use the “facilities” and complete other activities.  This would be my first priority because in the event that one of the FOPers stumbles upon these caves at night in an attempt to go to the bathroom, the outcome could be potentially very serious.  
	The next issue is would deal with would also involve the physical wellbeing of my FOPers.  The description acknowledges that Kelly is frequently shivering at breaks, it also describes that the camp is located in a mountain valley, which typically experience dramatic temperature shifts.  Due to this fact, I would discuss with my FOPers the importance of wearing layers and maintaining a stable core temperature.  I may also warn of the symptoms and signs of hypothermia.  In addition to this discussion, I would pay closer attention to those individuals displaying this activity and instruct them to put on additional layers in the event of this behavior.  
	Finally, from the description, the FOP group in general appears to be fractured socially.  As a FOP leader, it would remain fundamentally important for me and my co-leader to create a dynamic that is inclusive and respective of all and their backgrounds.  The situation occurring between Lizzie, Matilda, and Renee would serve as an opportunity by which to increase the amount of bonding between individuals not found within the same “groups.”  As a leader that day/night in camp, I would work to separate these forming cliques and try to encourage conversation with others.  One opportunity to do this would be in the competition to put up the tarps.  Working with Peter, I would place individuals in different groupings than would form normally.  I may also have the group do other team building activities and would discuss with them the importance of respect not only in the context of the FOP trip, but also with regards to their time spent at Harvard.  Finally to deal with these divisions the next day, I would suggest that the FOPers try walking next to someone different than they normally do.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[- Summer 2013: 3 day backpacking trip in La Serena, Chile with one friend. Together, we coordinated the entire trip (including routing, purchasing and planning food, finalizing the packing list, and finances, etc.). Throughout the three days, we traversed a desert, camped out on a beach, and hiked the dry mountains. The trip was by no means luxurious (we got most places by walking and hitchhiked five times in the span of three days), but it was adventurous, reflective, and enlightening, too (we slept under the stars and talked about ourselves and each other) just the way that I like my trips! 

- Summer 2013: This past summer, I was fortunate enough to see many parts of the world that I had never seen before. Although the backpacking trip above was perhaps the most intense out of all mini-trips, the summer was sprinkled with 1-2 day backpacking trips to the Andes and multi-day excursions to the outskirts of Shanghai. 

- Summer 2012: 5 day backpacking trip in the southern portion of South Korea (Korea is 70% mountains) with aunt. We walked about 15-16 kilometers per day, following a route that prisoners used to follow from the southern-most to the northern-most tip of the country in ancient times. I planned the route (and made emergency changes according to the map when a road was no longer there or unexpectedly treacherous), made the packs, and planned the food schedule. I was also the official “face” of our two-person trip and was responsible for making friends with people (when we were near a village) and asking for directions when needed and was possible.

- Summer 2012: FOP 2012! FOP was what gave a great conclusion to a summer of daily hiking and a challenging backpacking trip in the countryside of South Korea, and I couldn’t have asked for a better culmination. As you know, my roles included carrying food, setting up tarps, helping organize canoes when on ground, refilling water bottles, assisting FOP leaders when they needed help, and perhaps most importantly, making friends and making sure to LNT! I also sometimes took on the additional role of screwing up mafia games by claiming to be the detective when I really was not. :P

- Regular biweekly half-day trips (not during term time): Hiking has been a family pastime ever since I can remember, perhaps because it’s the national pastime in South Korea, where I was born. When I was young, I was mostly a follower and trailed behind my parents with my sister. But as I became more comfortable in the mountains and developed a love for the outdoors, I began to lead the half-day trips, make our day packs, and look into discovering new trails and paths.

- April 2006: 3 day outdoor immersion trip in the Taconic Outdoors Education Center with middle school class. This was a long time ago, in the 7th or the 8th grade. But it set up crucial foundations for me in terms of character and leadership that probably went a long way in getting me where I am today. The trip taught us how to trust each other in the wilderness or any other unfamiliar setting and to push our boundaries both physically and mentally whether on a trail or simply in life.]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[**Teaching and Mentoring Experience**

- Fall 2013: Founder/Coordinator of Camp IOP; Harvard’s Institute of Politics has a lot of things, but if I had to point out one thing that it lacks, it would be a culture of reflection and mentorship. To tackle this problem, I co-founded and co-ran an orientation program for freshmen called Camp IOP, where we introduced them to the various facets of the IOP (which in number, can be overwhelming for newcomers), led them through reflection exercises (writing letters to future selves, etc.), and most importantly, forged community across the group of 2017-ers that wanted to become a part of the IOP. 

- Summer 2013: Seminar Leader at the Harvard Summit for Young Leaders in China (unpaid); I taught a seminar (four classes, each with about 10 students) on connecting the themes in James Joyce's Ulysses to why people should lead a life of public and community service. Beyond that, I was "co-master" of a "house" with another seminar leader; through this job, I had the role of kindling house spirit during house games, etc. I also ran a debate/public speaking extracurricular and mentored students over lunch and office hours. 

- Summer 2013: Founder and Facilitator of ASPIRE NYC. In 2012, I created from scratch a leadership workshop series for Asian-American high school women. In a one-year process, I went through outreach, curriculum planning, logistics (finding a meeting place, soliciting donations), and facilitation, etc. Through this leadership experience, I learned crucial lessons about viewing and assessing situations from a birds’-eye view and forging connections and friendships with my mentees that lasted beyond the program. It also taught me a lot of facilitation skills, with which I was able to run better ice breakers, activities, and debriefs. In Summer 2013, I turned this workshop series into a day-long conference and am in the middle of planning the second annual conference for Summer 2014. 

- 2012-present: Project SWIM benefits mainly children with mental disabilities, such as ADHD and autism. I am in charge of one nine-year old child and I teach him how to swim and be more comfortable in the water every Sunday. It’s taught me a lot about forming lessons plans, developing real connections with both my students and their families, and employing patience in my teaching and facilitating.

- 2012-present: Director of the Athena Program at the PBHA. Athena is I serve as a mentor directly to one high school student and more indirectly to a group of mentees that come to workshop every Saturday. As a mentor, I oversee my mentee’s intellectual and emotional growth. We set clear goals for the year at the beginning of the semester and work on a clear timeline to achieve those goals throughout the year. Athena also runs a conference for high school students each semester; during the Fall 2012 conference, I facilitated a workshop on race, family, and gender, and during the Fall 2013 conference, I facilitated another on Gender and Politics.
 
**Leadership Experience**

On top of serving as a Director of the Athena Program, I currently serve as the co-chair of the Fellows & Study Groups committee at the IOP and the Senior Campus Editor of the Harvard Political Review. Both jobs (and other subcommittee chair-ships before I was elected to those positions) have contributed immensely to my development as a leader. They have trained me to see projects and organizational structures from a birds’ eye view and to develop interpersonal relationships with committee-members that promote development for both myself and the member. In both of these positions as well as in Athena, I am constantly looking for solutions to the challenge of forging community, an experience that has forged a valuable skillset that I definitely look forward to bringing to FOP. Furthermore, in both of these organizations and also in general, I have begun to take on the role of being a mentor to the new members of our campus in the class of 2017; long coffee dates and late-night conversations with some of my “mentees” stand as some of the highlights of this year. 

I've also advised the renewal of the Digital Literacy Project all throughout this year. Through that, I've learned valuable lessons and built up valuable experiences in thinking about teaching, mentoring, and imparting new (most of the times, computer science, which is what DLP teaches, is completely foreign to the middle students in the BPS system we teach in) knowledge to a group of students. ]]></Q6.2>
		<Q6.3><![CDATA[Since I last applied, the a lot of the most important and valuable changes in me and my leadership/teaching/mentoring skillset has stemmed from the fact that there is a whole new set of students on campus that look to upperclassmen for direction and advice. As I took on leadership positions in the extracurriculars that I'm involved in, I started to spend a lot of my time thinking about how to forge better community, how to create a more reflective culture in places where there is little, and how to make sure everyone felt comfortable and settled in their new second homes. 

This led me to co-create and co-coordinate things such as Camp IOP (the orientation program for freshmen at the Institute of Politics; see answer to above question for more details), serve as an HPR Mentor to incoming writers, and spend a significant amount of my off-time conversing with, imparting advice to, and learning from the new faces on campus. Because I come from a background of heavy involved in female leadership-related activities, I am a strong believer in tight-knit networks and mentorship; I have a knack for forging communities that last, whether that's a group of freshmen that stuck through Camp IOP or the 30 high school women that I select every year for the Asian-American women's leadership conference that I created. 

I spent a large portion of my summer reviving the aforementioned women's leadership conference, compacting an eight-week-long syllabus into a one-day long conference agenda, brushing up on my facilitation skills, and doing outreach to 100+ high schools in the NY area. The group of 30 that were selected to participate in the conference still keep in touch with me, whether for advice or for chats here and there. Through the experience of teaching the ASPIRE curriculum, I have developed valuable skills in teaching both the concrete (like how to set up a tarp in FOP-terms) and the non-concrete (like learning to trust each other, etc.).

Additionally, to be a director of any PBHA program, one must go through rigorous leader training and faciliation training. I sat through many hours of valuable sessions on visioning, training, facilitating, and group management, and I foresee that all of these skills will come into wonderful use as a FOP leader. Furthermore, this summer in Chile and in China, I built up valuable (and exciting) experience in coordinating multi-day trips (whether backpacking or not -- for example, I helped coordinate and lead a ten-day trip to the Atacama desert for a group of 30 people); through this, I also re-lived the valuable FOP-experience of traveling somewhere new and remote with a group of peers, and I re-felt the process of forging friendships and creating a reflective environment with a newfound sense of leadership and ownership. 

Lastly, I come with the experience of having previously applied for FOP (although that's obvious for this question). The past year has been given me time to reflect on why I want to become a FOP leader through self-reflection and conversations with current FOP leaders, etc. Time (and heavy reflection during that time) has confirmed that I would indeed love to be a FOP leader, and I hoep that that shows through this application! ]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.1>1</Q7.1>
		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I believe that my greatest strengths will lie in guiding my FOP trip not just as a physical experience but also a mental and emotional experience in preparation for a new chapter of life. My own love for the outdoors developed a few years ago when I started to feel a raw, human connection with nature. Often times, and especially when I was diving into something new, escaping the concrete of New York City and stepping on untamed soil pushed me to find my balance and self-reflect. I believe that I can encourage this same kind of deep self-reflection and connection to nature among the first-years that I guide, which I see as a central goal of FOP. Sharing an environment that provokes this sort of self-reflection and feeling of connection will also forge genuine bonds and a lasting community among the FOPpers that I guide. I think that friendships are formed not only by pushing physical boundaries together, but also experiencing challenges mentally and emotionally together, and I am confident that I can bring out both of these aspects as a FOP leader. Lastly, I have had much experience with diversity (not only race, but also socioeconomic background, family, hometown, etc.), which I believe will go a long way in facilitating fluid connections and community-building among freshmen from all over the country and all types of backgrounds.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My greatest challenge will mostly likely come from the fact that I tend to lead from behind rather than the front. I am not a big shouter or a crowd rallier. Rather, in my positions as a mentor, teacher, leader, and facilitator, I’ve always tended to lead by conversations and individual attention from behind the scenes in order to provide the most room for growth for my mentee, tutee, student, etc. Although I see this style of leadership coming into use during FOP as well, I do imagine (and gather from my own experience) that a physically demanding trip such as FOP will sometimes require leading from the front. I envision this potential challenge being overcome in two ways: 1) While I like to describe myself as a quiet leader, another aspect of my leadership is that I tend to take initiatives and step forward in times of difficulty or exhaustion. I trust that this will come into play when needed on FOP. 2) I believe that I can form a truly dynamic duo with a bubblier co-leader, with one leading from the front and the other supporting from the back, both physically and conceptually. While admittedly, I think there are both beauties and shortcomings to being a leader that pushes from the back, I will try my best to emphasize and take advantage of the beauties as a FOP leader.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I faced a difficult choice in the first semester of my senior year of high school when I had to let go a columnist from my school newspaper as editor-in-chief. This columnist had been a close friend of mine for five years, but was not producing his pieces at the stipulated quality, time, and frequency nor participating in newspaper activity as an official member of the senior board. The friend did not take it very well when I finally told him that I would have to cut him from the student paper. He thought that the fire was arbitrary and unexpected, and that he would have known to follow the rules had they been clearer. In fact, he wanted to “terminate our friendship” right then and there.

The factors that I had considered in deciding to fire the friend were expectations, delivery (as in whether those expectation were met), and that the enormous amount of effort being put into getting him to write well and on time were slowing our production process down. In retrospect however, what I had not considered was what should have been initiated from my side even before the consideration of expectation and delivery: communication, clarity, and agreement about those expectations. In many ways, this experience taught me crucial lessons about the importance of clarity and effective communication in group settings, especially at positions of leadership. Clear communication and an understanding that all parties agree on some kind of universal/community guideline not only make things a lot easier for the future but also help in forging tighter bonds (especially important in pre-orientation!) dedicated to common goals and ideas. I felt one great way in which this was done by FOP was the Crazy Creek agreement at the very start of the trip; we drew and connected the outlines of all of our fingers on the chair and wrote the things that we wanted on the trip inside and the things we did not want outside.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[1. Community: The group seems to be in the process of organically coming together but there are threads that have not yet been pulled together yet. There seem to be notable socioeconomic and cultural differences in upbringing between Lizzie and Matilda as a pair and Renee, and Philip has not yet embraced the group of FOPpers as his equal peers and friends. Furthermore, Kelly and Jack do not yet seem ready to open themselves up to the group and isolate themselves throughout the trip. I think all-inclusive activities (both one-time games and activities lasting throughout the trip) would go a long way in fixing both of these problems over the next three days. I feel that things such as taking turns to share autobiographies over lunches and water breaks, and lining up differently during hikes, etc. will foster better connections and more understanding, as well as give Kelly and Jack a chance to open up. All-inclusive games such as mafia and rotating word games tend to bring people together and form mutual memories. My co-leader and I would have to concentrate on community-building for the next three days.

2. Logistics and spirits: The summary reports that there was a large delay in the trip because Peter had led the group in the wrong direction for half a mile and there had been a thunderstorm in the early afternoon. While all the FOPpers are so far reporting very positive experiences, it is important at this stage to make sure that high morales and group spirit are maintained in preparation for the remaining half of the trip, which will present similar physical, mental, social challenges as the first three days. I believe that clarity, honesty (about where we are in the trip, etc.), and encouragement are all necessary at this point, especially during times of confusion and disappointment (like going in the wrong direction); this will allow the FOPpers to take feel a sense of ownership over their trip and develop as leaders themselves as well. For this to happen however, I strongly believe that #1 and #3 are prerequisites. A strong community will be important in fostering a culture of encouraging and helping each other and bringing energy to the group, while clear communication between the leaders will be especially important.

3. Communication with co-leader: While it seems like there haven’t been huge problems on this front, it seems as though a brief conversation (maybe after the FOPpers have gone to sleep?) is in order to talk about Philip and logistics (such as route, food, etc.) for the rest of the trip. Successful implementation of solutions to #1 and #2 come from clear communication and a unified vision from both leaders, and that will have to come through an honest conversation about the state of the trip. During the conversation, we will also talk about ways to integrate certain members of the trip, such as Philip, more into the group, go over directions and routes for the remaining three days, and set up a schedule to meet again for about 10 minutes every night.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[On the practical side, I think my greatest strength as a potential FOP leader is my experience outdoors. I am also generally calm and collected, and can think clearly under stress. Together, these things would allow me to ensure a safe trip or be prepared in the case of a crisis.
	On a more personal side, I think I would make a good FOP leader because I love adventure. Whenever I am outdoors, I feel a certain exhileration from being out in nature. Whether I'm hiking or canoeing or doing some other activity, I always take extra steps to climb a harder path, or explore around one more bend (though never if potentially dangerous) to make my outdoor experience and adventure, rather than simply a trek from point A to point B. I hope that I will be able to share this thrill and energy I feel when outdoors with other people, to make FOP an experience of wonder and appreciation of nature, rather than simply an elongated workout. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>I think my greatest challenge leading a group of first-year students would be that I would not be much older than a first-year student myself. On my own FOP trip, our leaders were both juniors, and even the two-year age difference made them seem far wiser and more experienced than us. Our leaders interacted with us as peers, but seemed to have the experience of adults. My concern is that, as a sophomore leading FOP, it will be much harder for incoming freshman to look up to me, and indeed, for me to see myself as a leader. Of course, I don't want to rule my FOP trip with an iron fist, but not feeling like I have authority over the students might become a concern for the organization of the trip. If I can overcome this challenge, however, I think I might be able to use my underclassman status to bring a FOP trip closer together because it would facilitate interactions as peers.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>Choosing to attend Harvard was among the most difficult decisions I've ever made. I almost turned down my acceptance in favor of a state school. Not for financial reasons or to be closer to home, but because I was intimidated. When I visited campus, I felt insignificant, and feared that here I would be trampled underfoot by Harvard's intellectual and social giants. I finally accepted my admission anyway, reminding myself that I wasn't going to college to have a good time, I was going to college to learn. 
	I made the right decision, but barely.  I wish I'd known then what I learned on FOP. I joined FOP with the same feeling of intimidation. Along the trail, I realized how wrong I'd been to assume I wouldn't fit in. I shared a love of poetry with the brilliant physics student from California. And the varsity crew recruit, who I had presumed would be a real-life case of the twins from The Social Network, loved all my favorite books.
	FOP reminded me to not assume things about people in college. It seems a trivial message--it's something they tell us all in elementary school. But I don't think I truly learned it until I made unexpected bonds with my FOP-mates. I want to lead FOP so I can continue to be a part of this accepting community, and so I can help incoming freshman discover, as I did, that they too made the right choice in their own difficult college decision.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5>The scenario described presents a number of issues. The three most pressing issues are those involving Renee, Phillip, and the quiet FOPpers Kelly and Jack. It seems that Renee is upset by some of the conversations the other FOPpers are having, and perhaps feels as though she has little in common with them. From the description of Phillip's interactions, it seems that Phillip does not consider himself part of the team and might even think he is above the rest of the group. Finally, Kelly and Jack seem like they are missing out on much of the group activity. These are all problems with the general cohesiveness of the group. 
	None of the above problems is yet what I would consider urgent. But they all certainly have the potential to become serious problems if they are not addressed immediately. For the time being, I think it would be best to assume good intentions from every FOPpers, and that none of them meant to damage the cohesiveness of the group. I would say that the best approach would be to try to remind the entire group to be conscious of the feelings of their fellow FOPpers. If the problems persist in the following days, individual conversations with a few of the FOPpers might be necessary.
	The FOP trip seems to have self-segregated into several different groups: Lizzie and Matilda, Mark and Suzy, etc. Some group activities on the trail might help the situation. Fellow FOP leader Peter had a good idea suggesting a friendly competition in putting up the tarps. Group activities like this, or simple games while hiking, would disperse the groups that are forming. It would include Kelly and Jack in the activity, which they currently seem excluded from, and would help Phillip branch out in his interactions. Group activities would help facilitate new bonds between different members of the trip, and make the trip a more cohesive, single group.
	Perhaps more effective than group activities along the trail would be an evening bonding activity. On my own FOP trip, evening discussion and sharing sessions were what brought the group close together and made everybody feel comfortable. One night, we each went around and gave a five-minute synopsis of our lives. I think this activity would be very helpful in the above scenario. It would hopefully remind the entire group that not everyone comes from the same place. For example, Renee has evidently not had the same opportunities as Lizzie and Matilda, and Phillip has clearly had more experience traveling the world than the rest. Kelly and Jack no doubt also have interesting stories, and perhaps would feel much more comfortable in the group once everyone knew a little more about each other. Establishing a safe environment and having each of the FOPpers listen to each other's stories would hopefully remind everyone to be more thoughtful about how their words might affect their fellow hikers for the remainder of the trip. </Q7.5>

		<Q6.1>My whole life: My family has done a lot of hiking trips although we never really have done much camping outdoors. For the most part my role was being a participant and navigating with the map so we wouldn't get lost.
Fall 2013: I participated in FOP Trip 18!
Fall 2013: I went on an outing club hike that I participated in with excitement.
Fall 2013: I went on WOOP
Fall 2013: I have went on a bunch of mountaineering club trips to go rock climbing.</Q6.1>
		<Q6.2>2009: I tutored a middle schooler in my school who was struggling with math.
2010-2013: I was a peer tutor in my high school for a bunch of different subjects and also a TA for my high school computer science class.
2012-2013: I had a paid job tutoring a few people at various high schools near mine in chemistry.
2010-2013: I was head of my schools science team and in that capacity mentored a lot of the underclassmen that I worked with on that.</Q6.2>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think that many of my strengths as a FOP leader would come from the fact that I have a calm personality. I hope that because I am usually calm, I would be able to draw out some of the more shy FOPpers, which would help them to form even closer bonds with everyone on the trip. 
I do not easily get angry with anyone and if there is something that I feel is going poorly, I can usually communicate this without offending anyone. I think this would be very important in communicating with my coleader. On my FOP trip, my two leaders always seemed to be in agreement on everything and got along perfectly, which I found very comforting. FOPpers place a lot of trust in their leaders and if they see their leaders arguing or unhappy with each other, I think it could undermine their confidence in their leaders. 
In addition to this, I really enjoyed everything about my FOP experience, and I’m sure this would carry over to leading. While this is somewhat about me, it is much easier to be happy when around other people who are excited about what they are doing, and I think that conveying my own love of what FOP is doing to my FOPpers would also be one of my greatest strengths. If something goes wrong on the trip or other people are feeling down, I would try my best to cheer others up and change the atmosphere of the group. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[When I began FOP, I didn’t feel comfortable sharing most personal stories about myself with almost anyone, and definitely not the people I had just met hours ago. However, even within a day or two of my trip, I felt completely comfortable sharing anything and completely trusted everyone. I think most of this came from the fact that my leaders set up this environment by sharing honest stories about themselves and opening themselves up before they knew any of us at all. I think that this would be the largest challenge for me; I am normally a friendly and trusting person when it comes to things that aren’t personal or core aspects of my personality, but on FOP at first I did struggle with opening up in this way. My biggest concern is that I wouldn’t be open enough or even subconsciously I might allow some discomfort to show and that by doing that I might cause some of my FOPpers to feel nervous as well. 
	Another challenge for me would probably be leaving my FOPpers to work out some of their issues on their own. Whenever I see someone struggling with something, my first instinct is always to try to help them however I can, be it taking some of the weight from their backpack, or tying a knot for a tarp. However, as a leader I would need to back away so that my FOPpers would be able to develop these skills themselves. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[A hard decision I have had to make took place on my high school science team, of which I was one of the heads. For one competition, we had 3 teams, one ‘A’ team that we tried to place as high as possible with, and 2 other teams. We chose the teams at the beginning of the year, but near the competition we set up a demonstration at our school to gauge people’s progress. Two of my close friends, who were also seniors, didn’t begin until the week before, and at the competition nothing they made worked. On top of that, many of the underclassmen on the other teams had worked hard the entire year and performed better. At this point, I had to decide whether or not to cut the two seniors from the A team. At first it seemed clear to me that it was the right decision, but then I started to doubt myself because I didn’t want to anger my friends just for the sake of a competition. On top of that, just the fact that I was the one making the decision made me uncomfortable because I didn’t consider myself qualified to judge my friends. Ultimately I decided to cut them in order to be fair both to the underclassmen and also to the rest of the team who wanted to do well. Although my friends were upset, they understood, but that decision taught me a lot about the difficulties that come with leadership.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern would be Kelly’s shivering. I’d worry that she is sick or getting sick, particularly because she has little appetite and gives away her food. Since she already said she was fine, I would probably just tell her nicely to put on another layer at least during the breaks. Since she is the quiet type she will probably not refuse, and even if she is hot, it’s better to be safe. At a time like this it is probably worth using my authority as a leader and I doubt that Kelly would resent it. This concern is definitely rather simple to resolve, but I made it my first one because making sure that everyone in the group stays safe and healthy is the most important thing on the trip.
Another thing that concerned me was the situation with Renee, Matilda, and Lizzie, because an important part of the FOP experience for me is feeling comfortable and safe talking with anyone in the group. My first approach would be to check-in with Peter. After assuring him that he shouldn’t feel guilty for going the wrong way and all of our FOPpers are still having a great time, I would ask him what he has noticed about them and if he has any ideas for what to do. Assuming he doesn’t, I would probably directly ask Renee what is bothering her. If she’s hiking directly behind me when she’s upset, I would assume that she wants to talk about it at least at some level and hopefully this would help her to open up about what it is. I would also ask her questions about her hometown, hopefully finding something that she would want to talk about. If I can remind her that her small town has just as much to offer as Luxembourg or New Zealand, hopefully she will feel more confident interacting with Matilda and Lizzie and also the students of all different backgrounds she will meet at Harvard. If at this point, she still only gives brief responses, I would probably try to hold off until another day and hope that they resolve things on their own. Sometimes having another person involved can just complicate things and I don’t know for certain what the problem is.
 	The last concern was Peter’s announcement about a competition with the tarps. The first issue would be that we never discussed it and I would try to check in with Peter more frequently to plan out what we would do upon arrival at camp. On top of that, competition isn’t something that I think should be a part of the FOP experience and I would tell that to Peter, while listening to his reasons. Ultimately FOP should be about bonding as a group and although competition can be fun, it makes the slower group feel that they are somehow less competent and those types of feelings cause more resentment than trust.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[Fall 2011: The Mountain School semester program in Vershire, VT. Part of the curriculum was an outdoor program where we learned to build tarp shelters, use topographical maps, cook simple camping food using stoves, pack a backpack, and use camping hammocks, among other backcountry skills. As part of the program I did a 24-hour solo camping trip and participated in an event where groups of students were dropped off in an undisclosed location and had to navigate their way back to campus using only a map and compass. My group got back first! July 2012: Rainforest hiking/trail clearing and ocean kayaking in Costa Rica with the Experiment in International Living. Since childhood I have gone on day hikes and camping trips with my family in Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico (the Four Corners Area).]]></Q6.1>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[	I think that my greatest strengths as a FOP leader would be my ability to read people and my empathy. I can usually tell when someone isn’t feeling well — emotionally or physically — and I think this ability would serve me well as a FOP leader, since I would be responsible for my FOPpers’ physical and mental well-being. The ability to read people would also allow me to address problems before they got out of hand. For example, I would be able to tell if two FOPpers weren’t getting along and ease tensions before things escalated to verbal or physical injury.
	My empathy would also be a good quality as a FOP leader, since FOP is  a challenge and  it’s important for a leader to be able to care and empathize with any FOPper who is having a hard time. I have a particular advantage here because I struggled with the physical aspects of my FOP trip, particularly the first day. I know how it feels to be at the back of the line and falling behind and I also know how good it felt when my leader said not to worry about struggling and continued to talk to me throughout the whole hike, even when I was almost too out of breath to respond. Because I’ve had that experience, I could empathize with someone in the same situation and respond like my leader or even tell them about my experience to help them feel more comfortable.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>	I think that my greatest challenges in leading a group of first-year students would be the physical aspects of the FOP trip. Despite my experience with day hiking and camping, my FOP trip was the first time I had ever been backpacking and I would definitely need more experience before I felt comfortable leading a group on a backpacking trip. Also, on my trip I was one of the slower hikers and found the weight of my backpack especially challenging due to my small stature, so I would need to improve my strength and endurance before next fall.
	Also, I think it would be a challenge for me to maintain a distinction between the roles of FOP leader to the whole group and friend to individuals within the group. I have experienced this before as a leader in orchestra when I have become closer to some members of my section than others and have had to be careful not to play favorites. As a FOP leader, I would need to make sure that I was not a friend to some FOPpers and a leader to others. Instead I would try to be a little of both to everyone in the group.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[	At the Mountain School, I lived with two roommates who were not getting along well toward the end of the semester. Kate tended to lash out verbally when she was feeling stressed, and Ellen would take the things Kate said to heart. As their roommate, I was faced with the difficult choice of deciding what to do about this stressful situation. At first I tried little things: laughing and joking with Kate so she wouldn’t feel so stressed, talking with Ellen and reassuring her that Kate’s comments weren’t really about her, and stepping in whenever I saw the conflict happening.
	However, as finals approached, Ellen’s feelings were getting hurt and Kate didn’t seem to realize that this was the effect of her words. Finally I asked them to talk about what was bothering them, since trying to de-escalate the situation without actually talking about what was going on wasn’t working. They agreed, and I stayed in the room as they talked it out, only stepping into the conversation if I felt someone was saying something mean or unfair. It was a tense few hours, but afterward things improved drastically. 
	Looking back, I wish I had asked them to talk earlier. I had been worried that one of them would freak out if I addressed the issue directly and the situation would get worse. At that point, I would have asked my dorm parent to intervene because the situation in the room wasn’t healthy for any party involved.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	The situation with Lizzie and Matilda concerns me for two reasons. First, it seems like Renee is being shut out of friendship with the other girls because she doesn’t have the same kind of experiences Lizzie and Matilda share, like exotic vacations. Second, Renee’s silence makes it seem as though she may be feeling insecure about her own upbringing when she compares it to the other girls’.
	To combat the first problem, I would place Renee in a group with either Lizzie or Matilda (but not both) for the tarp-building competition. Participating in a group competition would give Renee something in common with one of the girls and it would give them a chance to get to form a closer friendship without the topic of upbringings getting in the way as it would if Lizzie and Matilda were together.
	In addition, at dinner I would suggest that we go around the group sharing something we think is cool about the area where we grew up. This kind of activity could remind Renee that there are things to be proud of about all kinds of upbringings, and I would be sure to say something positive in response to whatever she shared.

	Kelly’s situation seems to be an issue of physical well-being rather than mental, but it also concerns me because it is important to be warm and well-fed to have a good FOP experience. If Kelly gets full quickly, she also probably gets hungry quickly so I would be sure to pause for snacks often on the trail to make sure she wasn’t hiking hungry. 
	Also, if Kelly is shivering during breaks but says she’s fine, she may be feeling like she’s the only one who’s cold. To encourage her to stay warm and show her that it’s fine to be cold, I would make sure that I always put on an extra layer during breaks and encourage anyone who is cold to do the same so that she doesn’t feel like she’s the only one.

	Phillip’s situation concerns me because it seems as though he is trying to prove how mature he is and is rejecting his fellow FOPpers in the process. To encourage him to make friends with his peers rather than only Peter and I, I would plan activities that for just the FOPpers. For example, the following evening, we could ask the FOPpers to put up the tarps by themselves since they would have already done it with supervision during the tarp-building contest.
	 In addition, I would make sure to listen to Phillip’s stories, but not shy away from asking him to save them for later if we were about to do an activity. This way he would receive the positive attention he may be seeking, but would also be reminded that he is not always the center of attention. I would encourage Peter to do the same, especially since he seems to be losing patience with Phillip.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[1)	Day hikes with family on a regular basis since before I can remember. Loved hiking from a young age.
2)	Summer 2011: participated in an organized (was a camper and there were trip leaders) 4 day backpacking trip through the Israeli Negev Desert. I got comfortable being in the outdoors for an extended periods of time and learned some basic skills like cooking and packing. 
3)	Summer 2012: As part of my job as a counselor at the Jewish sleep away camp in New York, I co-lead a five-day backpacking trip for 10 campers, age 14. We hiked a portion of the Appalachian Trail in Vermont, and I co-lead with a staff member who specialized in outdoor skills and with a camp-affiliated rabbi who runs spiritual outdoor trips for teenagers. Got to work on fostering a sense of strong community and appreciation of the outdoors among campers. I really improved my technical skills and team building skills on that trip. 
4)	August 2012: Was on FOP 7!! Yeah Switch!!! Had an amazing time and got to practice outdoor skills
5)	Summer 2013: Spent 9 weeks working at a Jewish outdoor adventure summer camp in Colorado whose mission is to use intense community building activities on base camp and in the wilderness to teach Jewish values and leadership skills and influence the character development of campers. The camp was structured in alternating weeks- one week would be filled with activities at base camp, and the next was spent on an outdoor adventure (backpacking, rock climbing, horseback riding, etc), and I had the pleasure of co-leading four different outdoor adventures (in addition to being a counselor on base camp). I co-led one backpacking trip with 11 year old campers, two bike trips with 12-year-old campers, and one technical mountain-biking trip with 16 year-old campers. On each of these adventures, I learned from co-leaders became more comfortable with technical skills and progressed in terms of my decision-making abilities, confidence in a leadership role, and sensitivity to camper needs in order to allow for campers of various backgrounds, abilities, and general comfort levels to work together and have a great experience. We also worked on bringing Jewish concepts about community and appreciation of the outdoors into the trips in subtle ways in order to strengthen Jewish identity and connection.

		<Q7.2>Having lead outdoor trips before, one of my strengths will be knowing how to step back and make level, flexible decisions that put the foppers safety and holistic best interest first and disregard any preconceived expectations I have of what our fop trip should look like or any other types of pressure.  Another strength is that I know I can work well with coleaders of all different personality types. Having worked as a counselor, another of my strengths would be always having enthusiasm and fun, goofy energy even when I am exhausted and being able to open myself up to new people in an appropriate. Because I have an extra year at Harvard and because my academic and extracurricular interests are quite scattered, I think I am likely to relate to a fair number of foppers and know about what Harvard has to offer and the many different paths one can take here. And what I think is my most important strength is the fact that I have absolutely loved my experience leading somewhat similar trips in the past and expect I would enjoy fop as much, if not more, which just makes it a lot more natural and easy to be enthusiastic, genuinely connect with my foppers, and make relaxed, well thought through decisions.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think the greatest challenge for me would be adjusting to having foppers much closer in age to me than the campers I have led trips with before and carving out my dual role as leader and friend. I tend to have a pretty easy going personality and would be very inclined to take seriously the suggestions of my foppers, which can be a good thing under positive circumstances, but could be problematic if foppers want to make decisions that prevent the group from benefitting as a whole and I feel uncomfortable pushing back and telling them what to do. Having foppers that are 17 or 18 also means that differences in personality that prevent foppers from getting along with each other are generally going to be more nuanced and difficult to gloss over (although bonding activities are powerful for all ages, they won’t always be a quick fix). Having foppers with legitimate reasons that they do not get along will make it particularly difficult for everyone to feel comfortable with one another. A final challenge that I have tried working on in past experiences would be paying attention to and tailoring the trip to every individual fopper with his or her own unique interests and needs. It can be easy to fall into the trap of a few dominating personalities coloring the trip but I would try my best to work on giving every fopper a voice so that each individual feels like he or she is an essential part of the group. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[It was our first night (Tuesday night) of my third and last bike trip of this past summer. We had gotten to our campsite by 5 pm and my coleader was set on moving on to the next camp site 2 miles and one massive hill away and making camp there so that we could have a full day playing at a nearby lake on Thursday and be the first group back to camp on Friday, a source of pride for the campers. Our budget truck with water and spare bikes had broken down twice, however, and hadn’t yet caught up to us, and there was one girl in the back who was clearly having a tougher time than everyone else. I felt uneasy about venturing further beyond our budget truck and felt like the campers got a hard and satisfying day of riding in already, plus I knew that my coleader was big on achieving exciting distances but sometimes let the little things slide. I had been resigned to letting my coleader do his thing because I generally was the more easy going one of us two, but knew that it would be better for the group to have plenty of time to set up camp and enjoy a fun, relaxed evening. I quickly pulled aside my co-leader to talk about it and stood my ground and we had a great afternoon at camp and plenty of time for the campers to cook creative dinner. The budget truck also pulled in within 20 minutes and we had everything we needed for the night. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The three concerns that I have are that not everyone feels comfortable around one another, there is a pattern of one fopper volunteering for everything, and the tough terrain coming the next day might push festering issues over the edge. 
	Renee, Daniel, Kelly and Jack might feel socially isolated or intimidated. During Peter’s proposed tarp competition, I would claim a group like Matilda, Renee, Philip, and Kelly to be on my team in order to give a new group of people a chance to work together. If people seem uncomfortable, I’d ask foppers for competition strategies and once our responsibilities were set, I’d ask silly questions in order to get foppers talking. Furthermore, I would make plans with Peter to do a special activity after dinner that we tried out when I was on FOP 7, where we are each given 3 minutes to just talk about ourselves. Our leader Ivo started it off in order to set a serious tone and create a space where we could fully present ourselves, discuss even the most personal things, and listen to and understand one another. I think this third night would be a great time to try out the game because we’ve been in the backcountry long enough that everyone has adjusted and can participate to some degree, but three more days is plenty of time for the benefits of the activity to play out and improve group dynamics. I would definitely have Peter or myself start the activity in order to set the tone like Ivo did, and we would make a point of not talking about any sort of traveling experiences or money-sensitive issues so as to encourage us all to bond over other, possibly less polarizing aspects of our lives. It would be made clear at the beginning of the activity that we are in a judgment free zone and that no one has to participate if they do not want to but that we encourage participation as a really unique opportunity to let out everything on our minds and understand each other. 
	It is awesome that Mark is willing to volunteer, and I would make a point of expressing to everyone how much we all appreciate his attitude. It is important, however, that everyone get the chance to learn outdoor skills and feel important. The tarp competition addresses this, and I would communicate to Peter that we should have the teams divide up responsibilities in a clear way so no one hangs to the side. Also, the next morning I would pay attention to how much gear Mark is taking and would ask for other volunteers to help relieve Mark of all the weight he’s been carrying. 
	In order to prepare for rough terrain tomorrow, I think the tarp experience and nighttime bonding will help the foppers be more supportive of each other when the terrain gets tough and make those who were previously not as comfortable more able to rise to the challenge. Kelly’s shivering, however, does concern me, especially because we were just in a thunderstorm and her clothing might now be wet. Before going to bed, I would double check that she has enough warm and dry clothing. If not, I’d offer her my hat, gloves, or warm sweater for the rest of the trip. Also before going to bed, I’d review the map more closely with Peter so that logistics run smoothly tomorrow! I’d also make sure we have as much water filled as possible before going to bed so we can get out nice and easy in the morning!

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I am a clear communicator, which will allow me to effectively work with my co-leader, teach skills, and direct the group. I have plenty of experience in the wilderness and am a careful decision maker who examines the pros and cons of any choice to obtain the best result. This combination of experience and prudence will help provide a safe and comfortable trip for the first year students. I am a very cheerful, enthusiastic (47 letters at FOP FUNdraising!) and outgoing individual. My positivity and energy tend to rub off on my friends and the people around me, and I am confident that that they will generate a fun and positive vibe for the entire FOP trip. My athletic background in rowing and table tennis has given me perseverance and a strong work ethic. As a FOP leader, I will work my hardest to keep the group motivated during difficult parts of the trip (challenging hikes, cold and rainy weather, etc.) and to provide any support necessary. 
I have a propensity for connecting with other people and being sensitive of their concerns. Even when a friend does not explicitly state some problem, I can get a good feel of what he or she is thinking based on his or her behavior and the circumstances. Sometimes, a first-year student may have an issue during the trip but is reluctant to bring it up. My ability to identify such problems, even when not expressed, and to resolve them will be beneficial. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[As a leader of a group of first-year students, I will face some internal challenges. I always have a strong desire to get the best possible outcome at whatever I set out to do, whether it is academics, a sport, or a hobby. For FOP, an ideal outcome would be for everyone to greatly enjoy the experience, form close and lasting bonds, and learn about oneself and Harvard. Since this would be my first time leading a group of peers in the wilderness for an extended period of time, I need to overcome any fear of possibly not getting “the” ideal outcome during the trip. However, I will constantly strive towards achieving that ideal.  
In the leadership position, I will also face external challenges. First, I must gain the trust of students who are not much younger than me. With up to a dozen FOPpers, I face the challenge of maintaining a healthy group dynamic in which no one is left out or treated unfairly. I must be able to keep the group motivated even during tough times, such as in adverse weather conditions. Another challenge would be upholding the vision of the group and the vision of FOP for the duration of the trip and after the trip: I would want everyone to develop a deep and meaningful bond with each other (which my own FOP leaders did so well) and to feel comfortable transitioning to college despite only having a limited amount of time together.
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>Before coming to Harvard, I faced the difficult decision of deciding whether I should commit to walking on the heavyweight crew team. Throughout high school, my identity was that of the student-athlete. I took both academics and sports very seriously. During the summer after I graduated, I got an opportunity to train at the Shunyi Olympic Rowing center in Beijing, which affirmed my passion for rowing. At the same time, I felt that academics should become a greater focal point after I go to college. As a result, I began to doubt whether I should accept a walk-on spot for the heavyweight team. 
On one hand, I knew that rowing would be a huge time commitment that could have a negative impact on my academics. On the other hand, I greatly enjoy and appreciate the sport. Rowing requires tremendous hard work and dedication, but pays back with equally tangible improvements. If I were to join the team, I know it would allow me to continue making improvements in the sport, become stronger and more disciplined. I also reasoned that being on the team could actually improve my academics because the time pressure would allow me to be more focused when I need to get work done. In addition, my teammates could prove to be great friends and a source of support. In the end, I decided to join the team. I am happy with this decision because it has given me everything I hoped for without compromising academics.  
</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[1) My first concern would be ensuring the physical wellbeing of Kelly. Maintaining the safety and physical wellbeing of everyone in the group should always be the first priority of any outdoors trip. My concern with Kelly is that she seems to be experiencing discomfort but is too shy to express it to the leaders because of her quiet personality. She is seen shivering during breaks, and shivering is a sign of hypothermia. Even if she says she is fine, her bodily response to the environment would indicate to me that she is not fine. I would ask Kelly to put on additional layers of clothing to keep warm. If she does not have them, I would give her any extra in my pack. I would also talk to her and encourage her to be more open with expressing any concerns or needs. I would check back with her regularly to make sure she is doing all right. 

2) My second concern is making sure Renee feels comfortable and included in the group. Economic status is always a touchy subject. Given the content of Lizzie and Matilda’s conversations, it is clear that they are from well-off families that could afford trips to faraway countries. On the other hand, it is likely that Renee is of a lower economic status, and she feels upset and isolated from the other two girls because of their conversations. As a leader, I do not feel I have a right to explicitly tell Lizzie and Matilda not to have such conversations. However, I will emphasize to the group the importance of having awareness and appreciation for the diverse backgrounds of everyone on the trip. When the group has such awareness, individuals will be more sensitive about discussing subjects like expensive trips abroad, and there will be a smaller likelihood of isolating any person. Since Renee is already in such a situation, I will have conversations with her, make sure she shares during group conversations, and show support and encouragement for what she has to say so she feels more included. By doing so, I hope Renee will start to talk more and feel better. 

3) My third concern is addressing Daniel’s interest in “getting trashed” with Phillip after getting back on campus. As a FOP leader, it is my responsibility to promote the welfare of the FOPpers during the trip and after the trip. I would have a private conversation with Daniel encouraging him to make responsible decisions on campus regarding alcohol. I may not get him to avoid alcohol completely, but I could prevent him from dangerous levels of consumption through a serious talk about the negative effects of drinking in college. In addition, I would have talks with entire FOP group about the presence of alcohol on campus and encourage them to abstain and make smart choices. Since drinking may be inevitable, I would also share information about the resources and policies at Harvard, such as UHS and the amnesty policy.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think that my personality suits itself to leading a group of new students into the wild of New England. I'm a proactive and can-do individual and get excited (and got excited on FOP) about practical tasks in the outdoors like tying knots, cooking, and the other practilities of camp life. I have a lot of patience for helping people learn how to take on new challenges and activities and for helping them learn new skills. I also have teaching experience and think that teaching is one of the most rewarding things I have ever done. I think I'm also pretty good at connecting with a variety of different people with different experiences and backgrounds, understanding their differences and similarities, and hopefully using this understanding to help the group connect. I think I have good communication skills for working with a co-leader and with my group. Last but not least, I try to be approachable, friendly, and welcoming to everyone I meet, and I try to keep a smile on my face as much as possible and to develop real connections to as many people as I can (even if I only seem them once and while on the path between classes). I also consider myself a deeply reflective person and try to understand when and why I end up being unhappy or making decisions that I later regret or why I make the choices that I do. I think this would be beneficial to a FOP group.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think my greatest potential weaknesses as a FOP leader would fall into two main categories. First: I always try to be as supportive and encouraging as I can; that said, however, I think I would have to be extra conscious of anticipating all of the potential challenges that my FOPpers might face at Harvard even though I may not have encountered all of those challenges myself. Having to openly and actively expand my perspective so that I can be supportive and useful to all of my FOPpers will be something I’ll have to actively work on. Second:  I'm sometimes feel like I'm not always being true to myself in the social decisions I make or the things that I make myself think are important. I often feel myself being pressured, basically by my own false ideas, to hang with people who don’t make me happy or do things for “how they come across” instead of how much I love them. I’ve been a lot better about this personal flaw at Harvard than I was in the past, but it’s something I still have to remind myself of every day. I think being aware of it would help me ensure that I can support FOPpers’ being true to themselves.

Outside of my personality, I also don't have a ton of outdoor experience and I'm sure that I would have a lot to learn in order to properly lead a group into the backcountry.

		<Q7.4><![CDATA[While I was in charge of my high school newspaper, I was often faced with having to support my friends during their challenging times while still ensuring that the newspaper got made. This might sound trivial, but making this paper was a full time job. There was one particular situation that presented a real challenge. In January of senior year, close to the end of my tenure, one of the managing editors (my closest subordinate, basically my co-leader of the newspaper) had something of a breakdown. She had been deferred from her first choice college over our Christmas break and was seriously questioning how she needed to prioritize her time. I could tell that she needed time for herself but also sensed the obligation and guilt she was feeling for not being in the newsroom to fulfill the commitment to making the newspaper that came with being a managing editor (the senior positions were 35-40 hours per week). She was visibly distraught whenever she was down in the newsroom. This presented me with a difficult situation, but ultimately with an easy decision. I relied on her powerhouse editing to move the paper through production, and I knew that I needed her down there. After discussing the situation with the other 2 senior editors, the 4 of us operating as the upper leadership of the paper, I could tell that my friend felt a real and oppressive obligation to the paper. I knew, and the other two agreed, that her well-being was far more important than whether or not the paper made its deadline. To help support her, I had a conversation with her where I told her that she should put herself first, that she should take care of everything that she needed to take care of in her broader life before worrying about the paper. I told her that I and all of the rest of us who shared so many hours in the newsroom and had become really close friends were there to provide her with whatever support she needed. 

My thinking process behind the situation I just described is how I always approach problems, in my life or in leadership. I'm a pros and cons kind of decision-maker: that is, I try to anticipate the potential outcomes from my decision and make the one that is the best of everyone affected by the choice.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Responding to this scenario, I have three main concerns. The first is ensuring that the entire group is physically safe and remains capable of safely and happily completing the remainder of the trip. The second centers on ensuring that each FOPper feels emotionally safe in the group and environment. My third concern would focus on the cohesiveness of the entire group and ensuring that the FOPpers will leave the trip with a support network that they can lean on during their transitions to Harvard and throughout their Harvard career.

To begin with, I would consider the physical safety of the group most pressing to attend to. Considering that the group just finished a particularly challenging and long day because of the extra half mile, I would check in with my co-leader about how he thinks the group has handled the extra mileage and to see if anyone seems like they are unusually cold or tired because of the extra hiking or because of the afternoon's heavy rain. My co-leader and I might go around to everyone to make see if anyone's gear got wet from the rain and if it did start figuring out a way to start drying it out, and to make sure that FOPpers with wet gear got the gear they needed to stay warm and dry.

Kelly's situation presents concerns about her physical safety as well. Her shivering during breaks and giving away her extra food makes me worry that she isn't getting enough to eat and isn't getting enough energy to power her through the strenuous activity of the trip. To be honest, I don't know how I would approach this situation, because one can't just tell a female teenager "eat more or else." I recognize this as a serious problem that threatens Kelly's phsyical safety (not to mention, of course, the underlying emotional situation that her eating habits might also be reflective of). I would discuss the situation with my co-leader and have one of us check in with Kelly, and ask her if everything is alright, if she is wearing enough layers to reflect the temperature and weather, and ask how she is liking the food. If it seems that some problem with the food is keeping her from eating enough, I would look into making any possible change to ensure that she gets enough to eat, so that she can stay safe. 

The second concern is that, at this point in the trip, the scenario presents several issues of emotional safety. These issues of emotional safety also reflect on how good a job the trip is doing bonding the group together and preparing everyone for the wide, diverse array of backgrounds and experiences that they will encounter back at Harvard. 

To begin with, Renee feels separated or aliented from Lizzie and Matilda because she comes from a different background and does not have stories to tell that would fit in with the stories that Lizzie and Matilda are telling each other. Because they come from similar backgrounds, however, Lizzie and Matilda do not notice that Renee feels exluded and continue to carry on their conversations as they see fit. In this case, all three would benefit from a change in the group dynamic. After checking-in with my co-leader to see that he or she is drawing the same conclusion that I am, I would consider the time of day. If it's the middle of the day and we still have a long way to go, I might try to shift the attention of the whole group to some unified topic of conversation, like favorite movies, music, tv shows or books, or get the whole group singing songs together or playing a group game, so that everyone is involved and no one feels excluded. This would also help Jack and Kelly engage with the group. While playing these games or doing these activities, I would try to ensure that every member of the group got a chance to have their voice heard, so that each FOPper could discover that everyone has something interesting and worthwhile to bring to the conversation. During the day, I might also try to have the group switch hiking orders so that FOPpers are close to different members of the group and maybe give each of the switched up groups something specific to talk about with the people they are near. To address the gap between Philip and Daniel, I might try to share in a conversation (or encouarge Peter to have a conversation) with them on a topic about which they are equally able to engage, hopefully so that Daniel and Philip can discover a mutual interest and hopefully reduce discussion of alcohol. I also might take a chance to remind the group of the ground guidelines for FOP that alcohol and partying might be a good thing to leave at least until they're back on campus (though they needn't feel that it's even a large part of Harvard life), and that they should just appreciate being in the unique beauty of the backcountry while they are.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[-	Various hiking trips with family: my family and I went on hiking trips throughout my childhood.  We have hiked extensively in the following places: Yellowstone National Park; Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Beaver Creek, Colorado; Tucson, Arizona; Stowe, Vermont; and Muir Woods, Michigan.
-	March 2011: one week hiking trip in Wyoming as part of a project week trip with my high school
-	March 2012: another hiking trip as part of my high school’s project week, this time outside Sante Fe, New Mexico
-	Although my FOP trip last August was the first time I camped as part of my hiking trips (all the hiking done above was in the context of day hikes), I absolutely loved the trip and couldn’t be more excited than to have the chance to do this again.   I would very much look forward to learning more outdoor skills, and would be honored to be chosen as a FOP leader.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I really admired my FOP leaders, and I would like to provide the same level of encouragement that they did for me to a new group of freshmen.  I am very enthusiastic about Harvard, and it would be really natural for me to share that enthusiasm with the group.  I am also willing to learn whatever it takes to be comfortable in leading a group on an outdoor trip, even though I don’t have significant backpacking experience.  I think you will find from people who know me that I have a good attitude in a wide variety of situations – I never stop trying and I don’t give up easily.  I am naturally pretty calm even when unexpected things happen, and I think this mental strength is one of the most important qualities you could have in a FOP leader.  Examples of this include taking care of my three younger sisters and keeping them calm when my mom had to go to the emergency room last year, running to get help when my younger sister cut her leg badly on a rock, and helping to hold her still in a rural hospital while she got eleven stitches with no anesthetic.   Maybe it is because I am the oldest one in my family, or maybe it is just my natural character, but my parents have always remarked that I was probably born responsible.  I would take the responsibility of leading a FOP group very seriously, and would consider it a high honor.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>My greatest challenge in leading an outdoor group would be my lack of significant outdoor experience.  I am an experienced hiker, but that has been from day hikes, not from the type of trips that FOP involves.  But from everything I have read in all the FOP materials, I believe this is something that could be overcome with all the training you provide.  I would absolutely learn as much as I could, and would be very open to any direction you give me in becoming an effective leader, because I realize what a huge responsibility this is.  </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I learned the hard way that my best friend Julianna does not respond well to hot, humid conditions.  The first time she fainted in such a situation we were close to my house, and my mom just happened to be in the neighborhood when I called her from my cell phone, and we got Julianna inside and gave her water and food.  The second time, however, Julianna and I were on a walk on the beach – nowhere near home or anyone we knew.  We even had water with us, but it was obviously not enough for her in those conditions, which is the mistake I made considering that this had happened to her before.   She started to feel faint and nauseous, and we sat down on the sand.  I couldn’t leave her, nor could I get her mom or my mom immediately on the phone.  I was considering whether it was getting serious enough to call 911 when some I saw some girls from my high school.  They ran and got a lot more water for us, as well as some fruit.  We even cooled Julianna off by pouring some of the water on her.  And then we finally got ahold of her mom, who came to pick us up.  Julianna likes to refer to this event as the time I “saved her life.”  I know it wasn’t as serious as that, but I was happy that I was there.  ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[This question describes a kind of disparate group, with different alliances and levels of comfort and friendship.  As a FOP leader, it would be my goal to try to find ways to unite the group.  Mealtime would definitely be a good time to do this, and to talk about our goals and schedule for the coming day.  A coach once said to me, “Calm is contagious.”  If I remained calm and confident that our challenging hike in the next day is something we could all handle and something we would also really enjoy, I think this would set the right tone for the group.  When we got up on the morning of a particularly ambitious hiking day with my FOP group, I really appreciated how confident and positive my FOP leaders were, telling us what an amazing day we were going to have.  And on our hike, they kept us talking, we sang songs, and we played games the whole day.  They were calm and chill.  They had the attitude – “it is what it is,” not letting themselves or us get discouraged by setbacks.  In summary, I would use the example of my FOP leaders for how I would conduct myself if I were chosen to lead a group. ]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[The outdoors is important in my life, and I hold the experiences—invaluable opportunities for growth—very close to my heart. My first exposure to the outdoors was in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Through an overnight boys’ camp, called Camp Pemigewassett, I had the fortunate privilege of being led on 2-night, 3-night and eventually 4-night trips throughout the New England wilderness. On these trips, I summited various peaks, the challenge of which allowed me to pushed my comfort level tolerance and fostered group thinking abilities. With the same Camp, when I was 17, I was lucky enough to spend twenty-one days in the backcountry of Olympic National State park, practicing my rock-climbing and glacier hiking skills. During this trip, I also served as the designated group leader for few of our longest trail days, as were required by our leaders several times throughout the trip. I’ve also hiked during college during the opportunities I’ve had to travel abroad through grants and research projects, mostly as a participant.]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[I’ve held teaching positions in various contexts throughout college and high school. (1) In my Junior and Senior years of high school, I was a Peer Writing Consultant for my high school writing center. For this position, I was responsible for meeting with underclassmen to work on their prose style and argumentative strategies. This position helped the way think my writing and the role of a peer facilitator to develop personal skills such as writing composition. (2) During the summer after my Senior of high school, I was an assistant counselor, responsible for the well-being of a dozen eight-year-olds. This was the first time I’d ever had responsibilities relating to the safety of others. In the training for position, I was taught CPR and opened to the various physical and mental dangers of young, adolescent boys. (3) Lastly, and most recently, this past year I have been leading a just-formed student group, Harvard College Students for Scholars at Risk (HCSSAR), an advocacy and self-education group concerned with issues on human rights. I worked with two faculty advisors closely to found who we are as a student group, what sort of projects and events we would be involved with. This position challenged my greatly, and since beginning college, I’ve grown most from this experience.]]></Q6.2>
		<Q6.3><![CDATA[Since applying last year to FOP, I’ve honed my interpersonal and leadership skills through founding and leading a student group concerned with human rights dialogue on campus, a group called Harvard College Students for Scholars at Risk. This leadership position challenge the way I thought about group responsibilities, self-accountability, and support that I need to offer to members of our group to accomplish goals we had set for ourselves. During the spring semester of my Sophomore year, I officially started my position as co-chair. In the early months, I was challenged by how to best run a group meeting, draft a group mission statement, host seminars with resident Scholars at Risk Fellows, and plan larger more long-term projects for the fall semester. In the fall, I worked closely with my co-chair, Madeline Holland who is one of my recommenders for this application, to successfully carry out two major projects—“Tell Me A Story” a Mahindra Humanities Panel and an Amnesty International Write-a-thon to acknowledge International Human Rights Day. We worked together to more than double our group’s membership and draft a leadership succession plan for future growth. Through this experience, I was presented with many challenges, ranging from how to run a group meeting to how do change the way we relate to issues of freedom of ideas and expression on a campus where these rights are often blindly taken for granted. These challenges have since better prepared me to become a more supportive member of groups and enhanced my self-awareness in group challenges, two qualities I think very important in being able to lead FOP.]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2>To FOP, moreover to the FOP community, I would bring a rich set of personal experiences and caring personality. Being able to think positively is important, and the ability to continue positive thinking habits through difficult and challenging experiences. In my opinion, FOP is longer than a 5-day trip. As a FOP leader, I would be able to organize opportunities for my group of first-year students throughout their fall semester to continue the type of thinking and discussion I would hope to have on my FOP trip, if I were to lead one. Having participated my Freshman year, I was thankful for the community and network of support that FOP provided me, as I was settling into life at Harvard. I am excited about the possibility of mentoring and keeping in touch with a group of first-years who are starting their journey at Harvard. As a dedicated friend and leader of a student group, I know well what it takes to plan successful, fun and worthwhile experiences on campus in order for my FOPees to develop valuable personal relationships amongst each other and with others in the FOP community.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[In leading a group of first-year students, I am most nervous—and thus would think most challenging—about the being able to think clearly in the case of an emergency on the trail. I find issues of safety most daunting in leading a group of eight through the backcountry of New England. Through FOP, I would hope to develop my abilities to execute first aid responsibilities and have the logic required to exercise in a tense situation. I do not have any experience in wilderness first aid, besides the few protocols I was taught attending summer camp when I was younger. Especially because FOPpers tend not to have hiking experience before going on a trip, I would feel most challenged by the need to alert them of the safety concerns on the trail, like drinking enough water, etc. With FOP, I would hope to develop a set of skills that would allow me to help FOPpers become more comfortable when on the trail and be able to ensure safety through first aid training.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[At the beginning of last semester, I had begun to lead HCSSAR with a then junior who became more occupied by her schoolwork and other obligations, such that working with our group became more stressful than enjoyable for her. During our meetings, she would unintentionally hurt group thinking by this negative attitude, which was one out of stress more than interest in what we were doing. One day, after coming back into the room panicked, she approached me about disbanding the group entirely. She felt obligated to be fully in or fully out, an attitude that I then confronted. She insisted that I should not contact our faculty advisor about the problem, but I thought it the best decision given our circumstances as a new student group. It was difficult for me approach my advisor our advisor about this issue, because at this time we were so new that I didn’t want her to perceive we were already failing and look different at this member of our group. But, by contacting our advisor and scheduling a meeting we came to the best possible outcome of complete mutual understanding and then recognized the best steps to take for our group, not just one individual, moving forward. On my part, this required me to think outside of my responsibilities and relationships with my first co-chair and look at the well-being of the group as a whole, something that felt very hard at the time. She continues to be a positive member of our group today.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[In this scenario, I am first alerted to concerns of safety and physical and emotional well-being. Before all else, one must be healthy and abled to hike the challenging terrain that is hiked during FOP. Above all else, I would make sure my FOPpers are warm, eating enough and staying hydrated. 

Related to this, I am most concerned by Kelly’s shivering, indicative of hypothermia. I would instruct the whole group, but paying close attention to Kelly, to put on more layers as we settled into base camp. Furthermore, I would then make sure the group had enough water, or located a source for safe drinking water (that we would then purify with iodine, for example). Kelly is also showing signs that she may have an eating disorder. This is something that I would present to my co-leader Peter in private. On the topic of safety, I would approach Mark about the weight he is carrying and ask other members, if any volunteer, to divide his load. Heavy loads increase the likelihood of a trail injury due to exhaustion or fatigue.

My second concern is that I feel like I am not on the same page with my co-leader. Without working together effectively, we won’t be able to address interpersonal issues or group development opportunities appropriately. Even though he did take our group down the wrong trail, I as the other co-leader am equally responsible for knowing the route and where we should be on the map. On this note, I would react with presenting, instead of having Mark help Peter with cooking, the idea that Mark should help in the tarp competition as he is already so good and well-versed in outdoor skills. Then, I would like to take the time in making dinner to touch base with Peter about our communication issues and other issues I would like to talk with him about concerning some of the FOPpers. In particular, I would like to bring up with Peter that maybe not mentioning the caves at all would have been a better idea, for they wouldn’t have known about it in the first place. Now, we must both be extra diligent to make sure we know where our FOPpers are and that they not tempted to enter this danger zone.

During our time making dinner, I would like to offer some ideas to Peter about night activities for the group. It is clear that our group should talk about the drinking culture on campus as members of the group having brought it up on conversation between each other. One way of addressing this would be to bring it up at dinner or during a group self-reflection activity. During this self-reflection activity, I would also bring up issues of affluence on campus and reassure that financial standing has little to do with your life as a student, with the ability to apply for grants for parties, etc. It is also apparent that we as leaders need to promote more group bonding, I would go out of my way, maybe the next day on the trail, to order FOPpers in way where they are encouraged to talk with others they haven’t been talking to as much.

I would like address some of these issues in more detail, but I am restricted by the word count.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[Once every summer after freshman year of high school (2010): went camping for a weekend with my family, participated and helped to do general tasks such as setting up camp. 
Went hiking regularly during the summers and falls every single year since 5th grade (2006)
August 2013: participant in FOP
Ocotber 2013: participant in WOOP
Before FOP, I had never had any form of intense outdoors experience other than the occasional hike in the Catskill or Adirondack Mountains about once a month during season. I had many reservations about going on FOP, especially about participating in a backpacking C trip. However, immediately after getting into the trails, I felt perfectly comfortable surrounded by nature. In fact, by the end of FOP, despite the long mileage and the grime, I felt an extreme sense of peace in and connection to the woods. Although it was such a new experience for me to be so immersed by nature for so long, I absolutely loved it and I have longed to go back into the woods since arriving on campus, hence my participation in WOOP. Not only did I feel at ease in the mountains, I thoroughly enjoyed it because being in the backcountry and completely cut off from technology, something that is so rare for me especially to do, gave me a lot of time to genuinely think about questions that I never get around to thinking because of how busy I always am. FOP gave me an opportunity to discover a passion of mine that I had never even thought of having. ]]></Q6.1>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[As a potential FOP leader, my greatest talent is talking and listening to others. I have always been sensitive to the emotional needs of others around me, to the extent that I place others’ emotional needs above my own, and feel the need to do all that I can to tend to those feelings. I always find myself being the mediator between my conflicting friends or the person to whom my friends turn during times of personal trouble. I am great at listening to people talk and providing them with possible solutions to their personal or interpersonal problems. This would help me lead FOP because I would be willing to listen to the prefrosh’s ideas, perspectives, and needs and try to help them through whatever doubts or fears that they have as they transition into Harvard. Furthermore, I am very social and friendly. I rarely feel awkward among unfamiliar people and it takes me little time to feel at ease with others. Additionally, I love talking to others, especially prospective or incoming students about Harvard because it has been such a blessing in my life. I personally came into Harvard with a lot of insecurities and doubts, both about the social life and academics, and I feel that I benefitted significantly from FOP and having two supportive and amazing people guide me through that transition and quell my fears. After having moved onto campus, I realized that all my fears were irrational and founded on many stereotypes of Harvard that were simply untrue. Therefore, having gone through that dramatic transition, I feel that I am mentally prepared to help other prefrosh go through the same potential fears that I did and suited to answer many questions about Harvard with the perspectives of a troubled prefrosh in mind. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My greatest challenge as a potential FOP leader would be making all the prefrosh feel secure in the backcountry, especially for those who have not had much experience in the outdoors. I personally feel that my weakest point is my lack of extended, intensive outdoors experience. Aside from an annual two-day camping trip and relaxed day hikes with my family and friends in the mountains nearby my hometown, FOP was my first true experience in the backcountry. As much as I loved every minute of my experience on FOP and am comfortable with being in the outdoors myself, I am far from perfectly knowledgeable in all of the backcountry “tricks of the trade.” Many techniques such as bear-bagging, cooking, or dealing with medical issues in the backcountry were completely foreign to me prior to FOP and even after having participated in FOP, I am not sure if I am perfectly confident in doing those things alone and teaching a group of prefrosh those things. However, despite my back of outdoors experience, I am willing and excited to learn all of those things and become well-versed in backcountry knowledge, from all of the different knots to backcountry first aid. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>Just this past weekend, at around midnight, two roommates in my entryway had a verbal fight, which led to one of my friends running away from the room. My other friend immediately came downstairs to me, looking for emotional support and advice. However, after spending almost two hours with her, we realized that the other girl had been missing and we had lost all contact with her. At this point, the roommate that was with me was getting progressively more nervous about the physical well-being of her roommate and wanted to involve the proctor. I had to make the decision of whether or not to involve the proctor. I considered first the emotional well-being of the roommate with me, who can sometimes exaggerate the urgency of the situation. I also considered the perspective of the other roommate, who may not necessarily have wanted to involve the proctor due to the myriad personal details that culminated to the fight. In the end, I decided to look for her myself first, and if I did not find her personally, I would involve the proctor and possibly HUPD. However, thankfully, she had been sitting in the dorm common room and I was able to calm both parties down and spend all weekend helping them talk and sort out their dispute. With hindsight, I wish that I had thought more thoroughly about the mentality of the roommate who had run away because after having talked to both parties, it was revealed that the situation was graver than any of us thought. Even though I was not able to initially hear her side of the story, had I thought about her mindset more thoroughly, I could have approached the initial stages of mediation better and less biased. </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Immediately, the first issue that grabbed my attention in this scenario is Kelly. From indicative signs such as her shivering during breaks and her giving food away to others, it appears as if Kelly is not getting enough energy. In a physically and mentally strenuous activity such as hiking, the most important thing is to be energized. Since the main priority above all else in FOP is to keep everyone physically safe in the backcountry, Kelly’s issues with not getting enough to eat would be my primary concern because it is potentially dangerous to her physical well-being. I am a firm believer in the power of conversation, so my first course of action would be to have a personal check-in with Kelly. It is essential to make sure she feels that the leaders are not “ganging up” on her but are trying to be supportive and help her, so I would choose to be more roundabout like “are you okay? I noticed that you have been shivering” instead of bluntly “you need to eat more food.” Additionally, we could take frequent snack breaks during our hike in which we simply stop and make sure everyone eats a set amount of gorpe before setting off again. To make this seem less directed at Kelly and to make her feel comfortable eating more food, we could turn the snack breaks into a game or a sharing circle in which the ultimate goal is to get everyone to consume more gorpe. 
Instead of two other particular issues that stood out to me, I actually view all of the other issues in this group as stemming from one overarching problem that epitomizes this group. This group suffers a lack of cohesion, hence the many different cliques of FOPpers and the general lack of unity and friendliness. If the FOPpers on this trip were able to connect on a deeper level, it is quite possible that Renee would feel more comfortable talking to her fellow FOPpers, that Mark would not feel the need to prove that he is more able than the rest of his group, that Philip would not vocalize his belief that he is more mature than anyone else, that Daniel would not look up to Philip in a unproductive way, and that Suzy and Mark would not want to separate themselves as a couple from everyone else (plus, no hop on FOP). To encourage more of a group mentality among the FOPpers, the leaders could facilitate this by involving everyone in games or discussions in which everyone would be able to relate to, such as common high school experiences or what everyone wants to do at Harvard. It appears as if the key to the discord is the very drastic differences in each FOPper’s experiences and backgrounds prior to college. The focus of conversation, then, should be turned to the future, such as ambitions and questions about Harvard or college in general, which all the FOPpers have. I found that the reason I loved FOP so much and why my group still sees each other on a daily basis is because of the consistent group unity that existed throughout our FOP experience. The leaders had a significant role in facilitating this unity, for they did a spectacular job of starting off the trip by uniting the group under a common theme of looking forwards to college. Although we all came from extremely diverse backgrounds, we are able to be cohesive even now because we started our relationships under commonality. Furthermore, I personally found that deep sharing, especially about emotional material, truly brings people together. Therefore, camp activities such as sharing failures or moments of weaknesses could be applied in this scenario in an attempt to bring everyone closer by demonstrating that everyone has experienced failures or weaknesses before. ]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2>One of my strengths in leading a group of first-year students would be my openness and inclusivity. For many students traveling on FOP trips, college is probably the first time they have been living away from home, and they are most likely scared and intimidated. I like to think that I am easy to talk to because I am friendly and have a good sense of humor, so the freshmen would not be afraid to approach me to talk about any nervousness they might be feeling for their upcoming college experience.  As a member of the Crimson Key Society, I got experience having to interact with freshman during Freshman Week and be patient while answering their questions. In addition, as a captain of a fall sport in my high school, I was the first person that many of the freshmen met when they arrived at boarding school for the first time, so I have experience being a resource for people who are nervous about coming to a new school. Through being a captain of several sports in high school, I think that I learned important leadership qualities. I am comfortable having to make important decisions for a body of people, but am also not overly commanding. Finally, because I am on the Harvard Varsity Squash Team, I am in good shape and could bring a lot of energy to my trip. </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>One of my greatest challenges in leading a group of first-year students could be my adamance in sticking to a decision once I have made it. I often find that once I have made up my mind I do not like to change it, even when others around me have collectively decided to take another route or do something else. My stubbornness can be difficult because it narrows my mind and impedes me from seeing the positive sides of others' suggestions. This might be difficult during a trip when having to make a decision in a tough situation and all my fellow group members and co-leader want to do one thing, while I think something else is the right choice. In addition, I often get impatient with people who are pessimistic and like to complain. This might be a challenge on a trip because I am sure many of the FOPers will have days where they are exhausted and unhappy and want to complain. I hope that I can be understanding of their complaints and not become annoyed or impatient.  </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[This past summer, I was part of a month-long hiking trip with twelve other teenagers with the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). In the last week of the trip, we were split up into three different groups, each with one leader; each group had to take a different route over that last week to find each other and the instructors at the final destination. I was elected as one of the group leaders, and found myself having to deal with a lot of responsibility: I had to plan out each day, map out the route, and motivate the group in tough times. Halfway through our independent trip, we awoke on a day where we thought our hike would only last us a few hours because there was a trail that we could take to our next stop. However, once we started the hike and got to the spot where the trail was supposed to be, it had disappeared: it no longer existed. We traveled for a few more hours in the direction we thought the trail would have led, but never found it and found ourselves in very dense woods. The weather was extremely hot, we were running out of water, we were constantly walking uphill, and the members of my group were getting both frustrated and scared; they wanted to stop where we were or try to locate one of the other groups for help. However, I was able to clear my head and focus on the map-reading skills I had learned over the past few months, and against my group members’ protests, I decided that we continue forward and navigate our way by using some of the small ponds that appeared on the map. After hours, we finally found the huge lake we were looking for that served as our landmark on the map. Although the situation had been stressful, and I was responsible for the well-being of three other people, I was able to focus on the task at hand, make a decision, stick with it, and ultimately find my way. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5>My first concern would be the situation between Lizzie, Matilda, and Renee. This situation worries me because initially the three girls seemed to be having a good time together and had a lot in common. However, recently Renee has been excluded because she cannot relate to the experiences Lizzie and Matilda have had that perhaps she has not because of her upbringing. I think it is unfair for anyone to be excluded from a conversation or friendship simply because their background has not allowed them to have the same experiences, especially since the three girls clearly liked each others' personalities since they were friendly at the beginning. Perhaps to encourage Lizzie and Matilda to be more inclusive, I might suggest an activity for the hike tomorrow that will be engaging while also distracting them from the difficult terrain. I might ask the FOPers that for part of the hike, they must talk to someone that they have not spent a significant amount of time with. They have to find out three things they have in common as well as learn three things that they didn't know about the other person. This activity might also include Kelly and Jack to participate a bit more and get more comfortable with their fellow FOPers. 

A second concern that I have is Mark's participation on the trip. I think that his enthusiasm is wonderful, but I worry that other campers are taking advantage of him and not doing their fair share of work. I am afraid that the others campers like him simply because he is taking the load off of some of their hands. I think that a good way to encourage other people to help might be to each day assign two "co-leaders". My NOLS trip had a format in which each day there were two LODs or Leaders Of the Day that were responsible for organizing the hike, delegating tasks, and setting up camp. Perhaps if we started this kind of system with two FOPers helping out the leaders each day, it would encourage other people to volunteer. 

Finally, I am concerned about Phillip not integrating with his fellow FOPers because he considers himself more "mature" because of his gap year. This worries me for two different reasons: first, I do not want him to insult his fellow freshmen because he brushes them off as not being "cool" or "mature" enough for him. His attitude is causing people like Daniel to flaunt bad behavior to impress him. Secondly, I do not want him to hurt his chances of making friends when he arrives on campus. Having this attitude will drive freshmen away from him because of his condescending attitude, and older students will not be interested in having a friend who thinks he is above being a freshman. Therefore, this issue involves both Phillip's fellow FOPers, and Phillip himself. To address this, I think I would talk to my co-leader Peter, since Peter's opinion seems to hold a lot of sway with Phillip. I would encourage Peter to use Phillip as a way to engage the FOPers who are quieter and less involved. Maybe if Peter asked Phillip to help Mark out with his tasks, or help get Kelly and Jack more involved, Phillip would be excited by the task since Peter is treating him as an equal and asking for his help. This would get Phillip more involved with the FOPers, while also solving some of the issues the others are having. </Q7.5>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Having taken a gap year before college, I’m slightly older than most freshmen and, I've found, a lot more flexible. I pride myself on being up for anything. In high school, as Editor in Chief of my school newspaper, I discovered that my favorite part of the job was teaching the younger students and seeing them grow in confidence in their own abilities as writers. I was also motivated by my love for advising younger students and giving them a sense of community and camaraderie. I applied for the job because I wanted to foster the same sense of belonging and comfort in the younger students that had helped me through my high school years, which then became my goal when I got the position. I have a legitimate and wholehearted desire to make people feel comfortable, loved, and important. My listening skills are conducive to this as well. The paper taught me to interview people in a way that allowed them to let their guard down with me. This love of listening continued throughout my gap year in interactions with people I met in my travels, as well as when I came back home to see my friends again. Additionally, I keep a cool head in difficult situations, which I learned to do when traveling in India (my stuff was stolen on a train with 10 hours left in the ride) as well as working at Cold Stone (people can get quite angry over admittedly over-priced ice cream).]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I find it hard, as a freshman having only experienced a semester of college, to be completely confident in my ability to advise first-year students in their Harvard experiences. I’m also very aware of my problems taking initiative in strange situations; I almost always prefer to stand back and observe how something is done first before I attempt it at all. Because of this, it takes quite a lot for me to leave my comfort zone (I’ve addressed this principally by stretching my comfort zone as far as possible). The lack of age difference would also make it difficult for me to separate myself from freshmen as a true leader rather than just a wiser peer, potentially causing issues in my leading of the group. This also creates problems for me when I set expectations of people; occasionally I find myself expecting too much of people when we are a similar age and I don’t see them being as considerate or as helpful as I feel I would be in their situation.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[All throughout elementary and middle school, I excelled at math. Considering this, I chose to take an accelerated math track. When I hit the eighth grade, however, my first two test scores shattered my perception of myself as an outstanding math student and placed me on the lower end of the average range. Struggling, I went to my teacher who suggested I simply move down into the normal math track. Her immediate lack of confidence in me sent me home to my parents with a decision: should I drop out of the very and only class in which I prided myself, or should I stick it out, risking my future in math? I believed in my math teacher’s years of experience in advising students on what class was the best route for them to take, yet I trusted my own math abilities and couldn’t agree with her diagnosis of me. I felt that she’d written me off as another student in the wrong class, and that she didn’t know me well enough to make that assumption. I applied myself more than I ever had before, doing double the homework and preparing in advance for each class. My grade skyrocketed, and I stayed in the class. While I don’t regret staying in the class, I’ve realized that one of my principal motivations in the end to stay in the class was for the sake of my pride--not because I thought it was the best decision.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	While the group exhibits a few specific notable social problems, my goal is to bring their disparate personalities together to feel like a cohesive FOP group. One of my biggest concerns on the path to achieving this are helping people who haven’t already formed connections look past their contrasting personalities, manifested not only in extroverts such as Phillip and introverts like Kelly, but also in individuals with varying life experiences, such as Lizzie and Matilda’s privileged backgrounds and trips, contrasted with Renee’s likely poor or disadvantaged family life. To combat this, I’d examine how each person connects with others, and try to pair them off with someone who connects in a similar way. Kelly, for instance, enjoys giving things away as a way of getting people to like and appreciate her, which is similar to Mark’s attempts to connect by taking the load from others. I’d encourage others who have already formed natural connections (such as Lizzie and Matilda) to continue forging that bond, but in a way that includes Renee. I’d choose a more universal subject of discussion, such as family traditions, to bring up with the three girls to encourage some discussion that allows them to continue bonding, but in a way in which all three can participate equally.

	My next biggest concern would be to help members of the group amplify their natural abilities and tendencies in a way that most benefits the group instead of causing potentially harmful dynamics. The most notable example is Phillip, whose slightly obnoxious bragging and high opinion of himself could do well in a leadership position with a little guidance so as not to annoy others and to help him grow individually. To accomplish this, I’d work with my co-leader especially to help him understand Phillip and his potential (without mentioning the danger in Peter rolling his eyes at Phillip), then speak to Phillip alone to tell him that we recognized him as a mature and capable individual, and we needed his help with certain tasks around the camp. By carefully giving Phillip the attention he craves, we can get him to try to connect with the group again, now in what he perceives to be a position of leadership. 

	Finally, my third biggest concern for the group is prioritizing fun. Although the trail is difficult, the biggest obstacle to this seems to be everyone’s individual worries: making friendships and connections or maintaining a persona that they want people to believe in. To really have a good time, they must forget these concerns. To enable this, I’d propose a game that involves everyone, and takes them out of the mindset of thinking about their social insecurities, or even a thought-provoking discussion or share circle that allows people to safely own up to those insecurities.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[FOP is an incredibly immersive learning experience on both a physical and personal level.  While I possess the physical component necessary to be a competent leader, I think the most important aspect of a FOP leader is that he or she can be both a listener and a teacher.  The leader has to be the one who sets the example of openness that the rest of the FOPpers will follow.  If the leaders are honest and willing to listen, they set the stage for the rest of the FOPpers to follow suit, really completing the FOP experience.
It is in this area where I excel.  I look forward to the chance to learn about the ten(ish) new people I hike with on the trail.  I think my excitement to know  them will carry over to their excitement to learn about each other and Harvard in general.  I will be a resource to them both on and off the trail.  FOP should carry over into the actual Harvard community, and as a leader, I will be dedicated to continuing the message of FOP long into my FOPper’s freshman year and beyond.  FOP is a time to open up, and allow long-term relationships to form on the foundations of being completely honest and genuine.  My dedication to making FOP as successful for each one of my FOPpers as it was for me is my greatest strength.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[The most difficult part of leading FOP for me would be to maintain that distinction between leader and FOPper.  It’s incredibly important to remember that there is a distinction.  I, as a leader, am responsible for the safety and well-being of each of my FOPpers.  Sometimes maintaining that world of safety and respect involves the need to establish a line between between leader and FOPper.  I have to maintain a degree of control over the group, which involves early on establishing my role as someone responsible for the entire group’s wellbeing.
	This is easier said than done especially when some of the people on the trip are less than a year younger than you (or maybe in some cases even older).  I have served as a leader with groups before, but never in a situation with as much responsibility as FOP.  I think the training trips will be helpful in developing the skills necessary to keep FOP both safe and fun for every participant.  I also think that leading with another person whom I have never met before will be a challenge, but I’m confident that during the pre-FOP phase of planning we will be able to form a constructive working relationship.  Leading is all about adaptation, and I think that, with some additional training, I will be able to adapt to the unique challenges FOP presents.   ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[My senior year of high school I had to make the decision between skiing in my last Nordic ski races of high school and leaving for a 3 week backpacking trip in New Zealand.  It was a difficult decision because it wasn’t just me who would be affected by my absence, but my entire team.  Both opportunities were once in a lifetime chances, and for the first time I really had to make a decision where there was no compromise, it was one or the other.
	Before I made my decision I evaluated the pros and cons with my family, and decided that I should take the trip to New Zealand.   However, I couldn’t make the decision without consulting my coach.  My absence would affect the entire team, and I would not leave the team in such a position unless my coach deemed it acceptable.  He agreed that New Zealand was an opportunity I couldn't pass up, so I decided to go.
	That decision did not affect my skiing performance for the rest of the season.  I was just as motivated to do my best and lead the team as their captain no matter if I would be there at the end of the season or not.  I left for New Zealand knowing I was sacrificing my chance to qualify for the state meet.  For the entire trip I followed my team through the internet, and returned to the US in time to drive to see the last race in the state meet as a spectator.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The first issue I notice is the communication between me and my co-leader.  It needs to be better, and we need to have a discussion about his attitude towards the FOPpers.  The FOPpers base a huge amount of the “feel” of the trip off the dynamic between the two leaders.  Cooperation between the two of us make or break the experience and the safety of all participants.  It’s possible that Peter is annoyed by Phillip, but if so, the two of us need to have a discussion about if.  So the first thing I would do is instead of splitting up to set up the tarps, I would have a discussion with Peter.
	However, there are two issues of personal safety that need to be addressed during the evening.  The first safety issue I observe is Kelly’s physical situation.  During the course of the evening I would make sure she was eating enough food and drinking enough water.  Hiking is a very strenuous activity, and if she isn’t eating enough, she is putting her safety in jeopardy.  This is also a difficult situation to approach, because it’s important not to call her out in front of the group for not eating.  If, after observing her during the meal, she isn’t eating enough I would take her aside and make sure she is aware of the importance of taking care of herself in the backcountry, and making an effort to eat more than she might usually.  The second issue is the amount of weight Mark is carrying.  Carrying the majority of the group gear could make his pack unnecessarily heavy, which could make hiking far more difficult and potentially dangerous.  Secondly, the name “group gear” indicates that it is a shared responsibility of the entire group.  In this case there probably isn’t any need to talk to Mark specifically, but when packing up for the next day, I would encourage everyone to split the group gear evenly between packs.  In each case, before making these decisions, I would talk them over with Peter during our discussion and see if he agrees. 
Those two issues are most pressing because they could negatively affect the rest of the trip from a safety perspective.  My next concern is to make the trip a more positive experience for all the FOPpers, especially those who may have started to feel left out.  After setting up camp, I would suggest we play some games (word games like contact or active games like ninja), or learn the Hungarian Foot Dance.  Those group activities bring each FOPper into the “here and now” and are collaborative and inclusive.  Hopefully that would allow Renee to feel more comfortable around Lizzie and Matilda again.  It also will probably involve teaching everyone a new game.  This puts everyone on a more level playing field, and especially in games that involves teams, build relationships such as in Daniel and Phillip’s case.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[My greatest strength would be in fostering a sense of community and helping everyone feel welcome and a part of the group. My high school outdoor leadership classes and NOLS trip this past summer taught me how important direct and open communication is, and I think it creates a stronger group if the leaders are willing to open up and be honest and genuine with the group and each other. I have learned to take the figurative temperature of a group and get a feel for whether reflection, group bonding activities, or just time to be together will make the group feel cohesive and genuinely connected. 

I think I could also be an important resource for the first-years who are shy or less comfortable meeting new peers and being in the wilderness. I can be introverted myself and I know what it is like to struggle  to fit in and make friends, so I want to make sure that even the quieter people feel listened to, appreciated, and involved. The WOOP and HOC trips I’ve been on this semester have been really important chances for me to reflect, meet new people, and re-center myself, and I want to make sure that incoming freshman, no matter their comfort level with the wilderness, can have the same opportunities I’ve had to connect with peers, themselves, and the outdoors. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think the most difficult part of leading is being responsible for the safety and well-being of other people. I want to make sure they have opportunities to grow and challenge themselves while still staying safe, and I would need much more experience with wilderness first aid before I would feel comfortable with my ability to respond to medical incidents and keep a group of first-years safe in the back country.

It can also be challenging getting people to come out of their shells, though I think just being in the wilderness can help people open up because they are forced to depend on each other, and are spending time with nothing to do but talk and get to know each other.  I think it’s really vital to create a supportive environment from the outset where people feel accepted and comfortable to be themselves, which can be hard to do in six days. I would like to take responsibility as a leader to set an example of being unafraid to be myself, to hopefully create a group where everyone feels comfortable to take risks without judgment.

		<Q7.4><![CDATA[The last five days of my NOLS trip, I set out with six other people on an independent exhibition without the instructors. We wrote detailed route and destination plans with designated “X’s” for each night, and then set out in the afternoon for our first X. The route was flat and heavily wooded, which made for difficult navigation, and we ended up a mile from our destination with the sun setting quickly. People were hungry, tired, and frustrated after several hours of bushwhacking, so we called a group meeting. We were obligated to reach our X for safety reasons, but people were on edge, communication was breaking down, and we wanted to set up camp before dark. Another girl and I went ahead to scout out the X, and when we returned it had come out that another member had twisted her ankle repeatedly during the hike and hadn’t said anything. We decided together that the immediate safety of the group was more important than making the X that night, and stopped to make camp and ice and tape the ankle. In retrospect I think we could have maintained better communication throughout the hike and kept on top of everyone’s physical and mental well-being, so we could have taken care of the ankle as soon as it was injured and before people got too exhausted and frustrated. However, I think we managed risk effectively in prioritizing the immediate safety of the group so we could continue hiking the next day. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The three most pressing concerns I see are:
1. Renee isolating herself and possibly feeling misunderstood or judged
2. Phillip’s desire to set himself apart from the group
3. Jack and Kelly don’t seem to feel comfortable to open up and interact with the group

These are of particular concern because I think the most valuable experience comes when everyone feels included and appreciated for who they are. Phillip might be insecure and trying to prove himself, while Renee, Jack, and Kelly don’t feel understood and connected with the group. The first thing I would do is talk to Peter privately to get on the same page and hear his take on these concerns. As leaders we need to be able to communicate well and consciously create the kind of environment we want for our FOPpers.  
	
That night as we eat together, I would tell the FOPpers what I’ve learned in my time here — that the diversity of experience at Harvard is the most incredibly special thing I’ve experienced so far. People here come from such different backgrounds and have such unique stories, and part of making the most of Harvard is appreciating the people you are with. I would suggest we do “two minute life stories,” where each FOPper gets a chance to talk about his or her life, uninterrupted, for two minutes while the whole group listens, asking questions after. This might help Renee feel like people understand where she’s coming from and the value of her experience. Jack and Kelly would get a chance to participate actively and let people get to know them better, and Phillip might find that his fellow first-years are really worth knowing and listening to. 

I would also suggest that Peter and I do private check-ins with each FOPper over the next day or so to hear how they are doing physically and emotionally. This would be a chance to address my concerns about Mark possibly taking on too much, Daniel feeling ignored by Phillip, and Suzy getting so attached to Mark.  This would also be a valuable chance to get feedback from the FOPpers and hear what they do or do not like so far, and what Peter and I could do better. 
Over the next few days, I would get the FOPpers together to play bonding games like Bunny Bunny or Yeehaw, so people could let loose a little and feel more comfortable being themselves around others. I would also encourage them to mix up the hiking order so they are talking to different people and getting to know each other more deeply. I think the message that this FOP group most needs to hear is that everyone at Harvard is fascinating in their own way, and it is their job as FOPpers and as people to appreciate each other, find out what makes each person fascinating, and let other people know what is special about them. ]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I’m a very confident and friendly person. This I feel would most immediately help in building a group dynamic that is both open and welcoming. I feel as though part of the strength of my FOP leaders was their ability to make conversation, or spark it between two FOPpers, which is something I believe I would be able to emulate as well. I also think my heavy involvement in theatre is something I could rely on as a FOP leader, as in theatre there is a lot of work done towards forming a good group dynamic. There’s also a lot of personal sharing that goes on in the theatre, requiring a lot of trust in the others who you are sharing with. Through my experiences in theatre, I think I'd be good at helping to build that in the backcountry. FOP, for me, wouldn’t have been such a successful experience had my leaders not worked hard to foster a similar sense of trust and safety among the group. Theatrical games can also be a fun way to break the ice among members of a new group and are a good way to brighten moods as well. Outside of this, I feel quite comfortable in the woods, which I believe would be useful in ensuring that the students feel physically safe as well, especially for those who haven’t had much or any experience in the backcountry.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[One of the greatest challenges I think I’d face being a FOP leader is the fact that I would be only an entering sophomore. Age wise, I’d be very close to the students I was leading and due to my limited time at Harvard, I’m not sure how much information I would be able to give students if they were to ask questions about concentrations, classes, extra-curricular activities, etc. I also don’t know how students would respond to someone so close in age giving them direction as to how to perform tasks, but in my experiences leading Unified Theatre, I found that these age differences didn’t always matter as long as there was an equal amount of respect among the members of the group (both those in and not in leadership positions) and that if anything, by being so close in age, I was much more conscious of how I was making my decisions and leading which, I think helped me get more out of the experience. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[In my Senior year of high school, I was backing out of a driveway during a night time rainstorm and hit someone’s mailbox. My car wasn’t damaged at all, yet the mailbox was broken at the post and was barely hanging on. Immediately I knew there wasn’t much to be done as it was fairly late, so I decided it was best to go home, instead of waking someone up so late at night. The next day I came to the realization that I wouldn’t have to tell anyone- not deal with the embarrassment or have to pay for someone’s new mailbox. I was presented with two options: not tell, or return and own up to my mistake. While I certainly didn’t want to deal with the issue, I recognized that had it been my mailbox, I would’ve been quite upset to come out and see that, so I ventured back to the house, uncertain as to how the situation would play out. At the door, I was almost tempted to turn around, fearing a confrontation, but I went though, and in the end, the owner was very grateful that I had gone and spoke to them, understanding that in the dark it must’ve been easy to not see it, and refused my offer to pay for a new one. I’m happy I laid the situation to rest and was honest both to myself and to the mailbox’s owner. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[        The greatest concerns I have are: the cohesiveness of the group, the way Peter is leading the group, and Kelly’s safety. Kelly’s health is my primary concern. Seeing her being quiet, shivering and passing up food could be a sign of some underlying problems. While its very possible she just doesn’t eat much, once back in the front country I’d make sure to check in with her to see how she’s doing regularly. I’d also speak with her privately at some point suggesting she could put on some more clothes if she were cold, as minor health problems can escalate quickly in the backcountry without access to health supplies, thus I’d keep an eye on her health for the rest of the trip and make sure she’s warm enough and well fed. 
        Group cohesiveness is a second concern of mine as it seems as though certain members of the group do not feel comfortable around one another due to their different backgrounds. The situation between Renee, Lizzie, and Matilda is unfortunate, as Renee’s upbringing seems to be quite different than the two other girls. Helping the students work around this is critical, as at Harvard, there exist background gaps between different people, so its critical the students learn to work around this. Starting a conversation with the girls in the intent of finding common things to talk about on the trail, such as what concentrations they were thinking about, would shift the tone of the conversation, even helping to end the “getting smashed” comments by Daniel, and integrating Peter and Kelley into the conversation. Perhaps switching up the hiking order could help in this, allowing students who hadn’t interacted much to try and find commonalities.
	Peter’s leadership is yet another concern of mine. While it’s inevitable that mistakes do occur, he could have checked in with me before leading the group down the wrong path. His eye roll towards Phillip and his promotion of competition is also not beneficial towards the development of the group. Competitiveness and a lack of interest in the students could lead to problems later on. Lastly his warning about the Gage Caves is a bit of a tough situation for me. Had we passed some signs for it, asking students not to go is smart, but if not, it seems unlikely that the students would know they existed and therefore he is only creating a safety concern by piquing curiosity. It seems unlikely students would wander a quarter mile from camp during the night and stumble upon the caves, but now I have the worry that students might try and go seek them out. I’d speak to Peter when I had the chance and ask him if he’d be willing to check in with me before making decisions such as which trailhead to go down if he was unsure, and to think about what might happen when promoting competition or unnecessarily alerting students of the presence of dangers that might not otherwise be an issue.

I grew up in an incredibly outdoorsy community, which has inevitably contributed to my sense of comfort in nature and for appreciation of wilderness. My home in North Vancouver was only a five-minute walk from the ocean, where my siblings and I learned to Kayak and Row, and from various hiking paths. When I would come home from United World College of the Atlantic in December or in the summers, I would go for weekly, and sometimes daily, hikes and swims in the Ocean. Moreover, wilderness awareness and safety precautions were extremely prevalent in our education (black bears were regular fall visitors to our home!). 
Another factor that might help one understand my enthusiasm about being in the outdoors is that I was very keen to attend a school called Deep Springs, which has only 27 people and is situation on a cattle-ranch and alfalfa farm in California’s High Desert.

		<Q7.2>I believe my skills as a leader stem back from a Human Interaction Conference I went to in my first year at International School. I had just gotten back from an intense outdoor trip with the rest of my class, a diverse group of 150 passionate students from 90 different countries and honestly, I did not know how to make sense of it all.  As I attended lectures and workshops on counseling, conversation and cultural bridging, I started to understand not only what it would been for me to feel comfortable in a group, but what it would mean for me to help other adjust in a similar way. I worked hard to live out the lessons of compassion and unconditional positive regard, I had learnt in training to stimulate meaning and inspiring one on one connections, while also maintain spirit and enthusiasm within the entire group. Leading an diverse international acapela taught me the first steps of how to bring conflicting personalities together. I pride myself on being acutely aware of my surroundings and particularly social dynamics. That is not to say that they do not often confuse me, but I find the power of observation to be a first and very crucial step in understanding how to improve a group dynamic. 
All that is to say I am social, I am caring, I am open to change, and I believe I understand what it takes to foster a intimate and safe group environment that will help cultivate excitement for freshman about their upcoming Harvard experience.


</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>Like I said, I am critically aware. This has, in the past, caused me to be overly conscious of the mood in any given atmosphere and always feel as though I need to address the things I feel might only be in the slightest bit wrong. This can cause challenges for me to look at a situation holistically, and remain conscious of the things that are going well.
I also struggle to gain of where my peers are coming from. In the face of diversity, I am accepting, but wish I could be better at empathizing fully with those around me. This is particular pertinent to a group freshman students who will want to have themselves heard beyond their name and where they are from.  I will be a challenge, an exciting challenge, to remember and relive the experience of novelty that comes with having just arrived in a new environment. 
</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[My decision apply to UWC Atlantic College was not a life or death matter, and saying that is necessarily change the outcome of my life would be too presumptuous. That said, it was a difficult decision in the moment. For context, the school is a 2-year international scholarship based school in rural wales, founded on principle of peace, sustainability, and intercultural understanding. Indeed, it was very appealing. Up until I applied I had been a serious classical pianist. It had defined my life, my understanding of my surroundings, and in many ways my relationships. In my decision to apply to UWC, I remember considering it to be a of opportunity cost. If I went to this school, I would have little access to piano lessons, and I would loose out on a significant portion of who I was. As a sixteen year old who was very conscious of her things that defined her, I was becoming aware that going away would not only expose me to a new academic and geographic environment (two things by which I was very excited) but it would also leave me vulnerable to a new set of identifying characteristics. This vulnerability scared me. What I wish I had considered, and what would have made this decision much less difficult, was that being giving the opportunity to redefining myself, or rather, to figure out the characteristics that may have already been integral to who I was, would give me a sense of confidence that I had lacked. I wish I had considered how distance would both positively and negatively affect my relationship with my family, and how the constraint of living away from musical instruction, would actually give me the freedom to explore other facets of music. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The most pressing issue for me is that of Kelly’s health. As a leader of an outdoor activity, it seems my primary job is to take care of health and safety issues. Addressing her shivering and not letting her dismiss my concern easily is important. Her shivering could be temporary, but I could also be a sign of illness, or potential of hypothermia. I would provide the necessary clothing to warm her, and assess weather she has a fever. Furthermore, her eating habits are concerning. The way she frames giving away her food doesn’t ring true. If she is doing it just to be nice, then her reason would not be because she were full. Furthermore, if she is not eating enough, not only might this be a sign of a psychologically damaging eating disorder, but it is immediately pressing because she may not have enough energy for the day ahead. I would remind the group of the importance of eating the cookies and dessert treats for energy, and address it with her in person if she continues to not eat enough.

Secondly, I would address the issues of alienation due to upbringing in the cases of Lizzie, Matilda and Renee. Renee, having been excluded because of her unavoidable inability to contribute a conversation, would likely feel very out of place. Not only would this begin to define her experience on the FOP trip, but it might also cause her to extrapolate these feelings to her upcoming experience at Harvard. If she starts to feel like she won’t feel welcome at Harvard, then this freshman program hasn’t served its purpose, and has actually been counter effective. I would try to engage the group is walking activities that every can participate it, whether they be riddles or wilderness observation games. Personally, I would remind the group of the importance of getting to know each person in the group well in order to foster a good environment. Another nice game to play is one in which you get partnered up with someone and you see how quickly you can find something you have in common – it normally isn’t very hard! 

My third concern would likely be of the sentiments that are felt towards Phillip. Again, the concern if of alienation of Daniel, who clearly is disappointed with the outcome of his interactions and of Peter, who seems to feel stuck and is fostering negative feelings for Phillip.  There is also a fear that Phillip will lose out on the potential of making very good friends. I would want to create opportunities for everyone to be talking about the same thing. If it seems to be getting worse, I would first remind the group to be sensitive of other peoples backgrounds and perspectives, but I might also talk to Phillip on my own and mention that while his experience are impressive and make good stories, there are others who haven’t been as fortunate and that instead, we should focus on this particular hike.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[As a Minnesotan, the outdoors has been an integral aspect of my life since childhood. I haven’t, however, spent a week backpacking as FOP does. Living on a lake from 3rd to 9th grade, water sports, canoeing, and kayaking were part of everyday life. As was going to the cabin to hike, four wheel, and fish. Additionally, from kindergarten to high school I was a part of the Girl Scouts and the Venture Scouts portion of Boy Scouts for America. In this context we would participate in many outdoor activities, go camping, learn how to build fires, underground stoves and other necessary survival skills. Moreover my family is avid National Park explorers. Since 2003 my family has explored over 200 national parks in the US. Although many are national monuments, national battlefields, or other historical sites, many we have visited are national parks in the traditional sense. Our first time exploring when I was 11: we spent 5 weeks driving and camping in the Western part of the US. Since high school, however, my family camping trips and hikes have become less frequent as other parts of life have become more prominent; this is one reason why I am interested in joining FOP. ]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Citizenship Tutoring at the IOP: This program partners undergraduate students with Harvard employees to teach them civic, reading and writing skills to pass their citizenship exam. As a freshman in the program I was matched with my employee, Luis, and he passed his test in the spring. The next semester I was an assistant teacher for a class of 8-10 employees learning computer literacy for two hours each week. Last spring I was elected the program chair of the committee and spent the last year leading the program. In the past year I helped train, organize, and help 60 new tutors aid 10 employees pass their exam last spring and 5 more this fall. 

Adams House Committee: Working with a group of 10 members to create a connected house community through a variety of events each week; this has provided a leadership opportunity as well as many lessons in teamwork and communication. As service and outings chair this past year I have led and participated in a variety of events for our 400-person house community. 

Kappa Kappa Gamma: As a member of our leadership council as registrar this past year and Vice President of Academic Excellence in the upcoming year, I have been involved with a group of 15 other students to plan events and create community within our 160-member chapter. My responsibilities included coordinating a composite photo shoot and acting as a liaison between the chapter and the composite service. Additionally, I was responsible for communicating and filing paperwork with our National Sorority Headquarters to maintain chapter standing, initiate new women, and archive chapter history. 

Additionally I have been involved in many informal teaching and mentoring experiences including helping coach my speech team each J-Term, and mentoring freshmen in the IOP, Kappa, and Adams’ little Acorn programs.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[My strengths in a FOP setting include comfort in the outdoors, experiences creating community within a variety of groups, interpersonal communication abilities and positive attitude to motivate the group. As stated I’ve been in the outdoors my entire life, and would feel comfortable leading a group of freshmen with or without prior experience in the outdoors on a hiking trip. Additionally one of the most important elements of FOP is introducing the freshmen to college life and creating an initial support system. My roles in other communities I’m a part of will aid me in fostering strong ties between the freshmen in my trip. Also, one of the key parts about leading a trip such as FOP is communication between all members, whether it is answering questions about college, keeping the students safe near a ravine, or keeping calm in a medical emergency. My experiences in both a leadership and membership role I have developed and valued open lines of communication and feedback. Finally, on day 5 of the trip when climbing the next hill looks challenging, the ability to motivate FOPpers and remain optimistic and positive is crucial. This element is often forgotten about, but when you hike 3 miles in the wrong direction and then have to turn around, or your gado gado is not appealing, the ability to remain upbeat and positive is important. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>My greatest challenge leading a FOP trip would be balancing my role as a friend as well as leader to my FOPpers in the context of the trip. As a FOP leader you need to lead 8-10 students who may not have outdoors experience, keep them safe and healthy, and ensure that the students recognize that you are the leader and that they know to follow your direction. On the other hand, the purpose of the program is to create a social support network for the students and prepare them for their college journey ahead. In that sense, developing personal friendships with the FOPpers is essential for the coming year ahead. I believe balancing both desires and requirements of the FOP trip will be a challenge, but one that would learn how to manage before the trip in training. Additionally I believe that balance could be discussed with my co-leader to determine the best ways to proceed depending on our leadership styles and personalities. </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One recent decision was deciding whether or not to run for the Adams HoCo Co-Chair position. Deciding to run may seem quite simple, and friends gave me the advice to decide based on whether I wanted the position or not. That reasoning however was a vast simplification of the factors I considered when making my decision. First, I had lost a prior election prior, allowing me to consider running. Prior I didn’t believe I could do both to the highest potential of the role. Moreover, I had previously told several of my friends in Adams that I was not going to run for the position. As someone who places the highest value on honesty and commitment to my word, the potential to contradict a prior declaration required substantial consideration. Also, after working with my fellow members of the committee over the past year, considering their involvement and desires for the position weighed heavily on my mind as well. The political side of me also contended that running to make the election competitive was a worthy goal as well. A competitive election would allow all the candidates to create concrete plans to improve the House. After weighing each consideration I decided that I was going to run, both because I knew I brought a unique perspective and innovative ideas and to ensure that the House would elect leaders who had clear ideas for the upcoming year. Additionally, I also talked to my friends about discussed my reasons for changing my mind.   ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[In this situation, the first step would be to ensure the safety and health of my FOPpers. Specifically, I would make sure to set up camp before dark and make note to all the students of the direction of the Gage Caves once camp was set up. Additionally I would tie a rope or other reminder around the trees in that direction as a precautionary reminder to any students who might need to use the restroom later in the evening or have other cause to leave the camp. 

The next step I would take would be to meet with Peter, my co-leader, to discuss my observations from the day as well as his. Discussing the best ways to handle each situation and then setting a course of action to progress towards the goals the next day would be the most effective. Additionally, I would be sure to check-in each night to gain feedback on how things were going on the concerns we discussed the night before as well as any new concerns he observed and I had not.  The most pressing concerns for me will always to ensure the safety of my FOPpers first and foremost. In this case making sure that Kelly is not becoming hypothermic, second talking to Mark about potential risks.

	In order to address Kelly’s situation I would pull her to the side and ask her specific questions about how she’s feeling and whether she has any signs of hypothermia or other potential medical condition. Especially since it rained in the afternoon if she is still wet and cold outside there is a potential for Kelly to become hypothermic. If that is the case I would make sure to help her change out of her wet clothes and put dry ones on. Then make sure she sits walks around by the fire to warm up and eats some high-energy snacks. Additionally, I would talk to her about the importance of eating enough to maintain your energy while hiking and that differs from an average day at home, therefore it is important the she eat enough as well as her high calorie dessert treats to make sure she is getting sufficient nourishment. 

Once making sure that Kelly was okay I would talk to Mark. First I would make sure that he is okay after overexerting himself carrying too much gear earlier. Once I knew he was okay I would discuss the potential risks involved in activities such as carrying to much weight to ensure that he understands the consequences and will ask for assistance or take two trips next time. Also I would make sure to thank him for all his help so far in the trip. 

After taking care of Kelly and Mark as well as my other concerns, I would sit down with the group as a whole to discuss how everyone is feeling so far and create a space to discuss their personal stories, college concerns, and topics to bond the group together.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I have experience and confidence in being a leader in a backcountry environment, and am really enthusiastic about facilitating a safe and positive experience for first-years, while helping ease their transition to college. That was kind of a mouthful, but basically, I’m really excited about the prospect of introducing Harvard to a group of first-years. When leaders have genuine passion and enthusiasm for what they’re doing, it easily translates to the group around them, which is especially important for a group of first-years hailing from varying backgrounds who are dealing with the inherent adversities of a backpacking trip. I feel that I would be a responsible and thoughtful leader, who also knows how powerful being goofy and amiable can be in building bonds between a group. As a junior, I have a lot of personal experiences at Harvard to draw from, and am excited about being a mentor and friend for a group of first-year students.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[Mountains (and likely first-years as well) often have a way of presenting new and unique challenges that you haven’t directly prepared for. I could definitely use some brushing up with some backcountry skills such as camp set-up and stove operation, and need to learn other skills like setting up a bear bag. I have also tended towards being a lead-by-example sort of leader in the past, and while that is certainly an important trait, in the backcountry, directive leadership is often required to maintain a safe and comfortable environment for all. I would say that I've made a conscious effort to be more of a directive leader this year, mostly in the realm of the frisbee team, and am excited about my progress in that regard. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Two summers ago, I was working at Galehead Hut in the White Mountains. The next hut over, Greenleaf Hut, is 7.7 miles away, and the hike from Greenleaf to Galehead is widely considered to be the toughest inter-hut hike in the Whites. One morning we got a radio call from Greenleaf, they told us about a guest who had hiked up the night before, and was planning on heading over to Galehead. Last year, this same hiker attempted the same hike from Greenleaf to Galehead, and needed assistance about halfway through, and it was unclear if he would be able to make it this year. Around 4PM we got a call from the caretaker at Garfield Shelter, 2.2 miles from Galehead on the trail from Greenleaf. This hiker had just reached the shelter to refill water, was complaining about an injured knee, and was moving at a very slow pace. The caretaker tried to convince him to stay at the shelter for the night, as the next 2.2 miles were pretty rugged, and nightfall wasn’t far off. The hiker furiously insisted on continuing though, and left the shelter for our hut around 5 PM. 
	After serving dinner to our guests, it was 8 PM, and there was no sign of this hiker. It was at this point that I faced the difficult decision of whether to go out and help him, or just stay put for the time being. The hiker had knowingly put himself in a dangerous situation (and it wasn’t the first time, either), but my first instinct in any situation like this was always to go out and help. Ultimately, after talking it over with my crew, we decided not to go out, and instead to wait for him. It was dark at this point, and we would be putting ourselves at risk for someone who, again, had consciously put themselves in this difficult situation. It was a warm, clear night, and the caretaker had given the man plenty of food and water. Sure enough, at around 10 PM the hiker finally made it to the hut. We greeted him with warm soup and a pitcher of Gatorade, and felt assured in our decision to stay put.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Before doing anything else, I would want to talk to Peter and make sure we’re on the same page. I would share my observations with him, and see what things looked like from his perspective. I would want to know if he’s feeling somewhat exasperated by Phillip, as addressing something like that before it develops further is very important. From reading the scenario, the person I’m most concerned about would be Kelly. While the other issues were all group dynamic related, there’s a chance she could have health issues, which need to be addressed first. If I continue to see her shivering during breaks, I would make sure she’s getting enough snacks and water, and would put more emphasis on layering, especially during breaks. If she starts to become grumpy and removed, or displays other signs of hypothermia, I would become more assertive with her.
	To give a gross oversimplification of the other FOPpers, it sounds like helping them find more common ground with each other would go a long way towards helping group dynamics. I’m sure FOP arms its leaders with an arsenal of ice-breakers, so I would try to facilitate a (re)discovery of common interests and bonds within the group. I would make an extra effort to try to keep the group from splintering into subgroups, as it sounds like both Lizzie and Matilda, and Mark and Suzy could potentially head in that direction. So a brief review of my priorities/preparations: 1) Check in with Peter 2) Keep tabs on Kelly’s health 3) Try to improve and build relationships throughout the whole group. It’s unrealistic to think that every FOPper will become best friends with one another, but a wilderness setting is a great place to build deep bonds with others, even strangers. The fact that they all seem to be having a positive experience is comforting, but I’d look to build off of that positivity to create an even closer-knit group.

		<Q6.1>Junior and senior year of high school: Went on approximately 6 day-long hiking trips with my tutor and friends. 
December 2011: Planned and completed a 2-day hiking trip at the Yellow Mountains in Anhui, China. 
December 2012: Planned a day-long trail walking on Lamma Island, Hong Kong with 3 friends. 
May 2013: Joined the Harvard Outing Club trip to Blue Hills, MA. 

While I have spent time in the outdoors as the list above suggests, I recognize that the nature of most of these trips are vary different from that of FOP. Most of the trips that I have gone on have a set trail. As such, I have little experience in navigation in the outdoors. Furthermore, most of these trips are only a day-long, and did not require me knowing how to set up a tarp or other relevant skills. That said, this makes me all the more excited about gaining new familiarity with the outdoors through FOP and experiencing the outdoors in new and different ways.

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Academic Year 2011 (High School): I was a coordinator for a service program at my high school. The program had two components. The first was visit to elderly homes. We went to visit elderly in a low-income district of the city and took them out for walks in the neighborhood bi-weekly. The second part was Best Buddies program where we were each partnered up with a intellectually disabled buddy for bi-weekly excursions. I was also a co-initiator for a photographic critique group on campus with another friend to bring students who were interested in photography together and to explore photography through mutual teaching and group learning. 

Summer 2012: I volunteered at Summerbridge Hong Kong as a student-teacher, teaching movie and video-making to a class of 17 students. I was trained to make effective lesson plans, and helped implement the student-teaching day when my students taught other students something they learnt. I was also a personal teacher to a former graduate of the program who returned as a future-teacher. We cooperated together to plan classes and lead classroom activities. 

Academic Year 2012 (Harvard): I volunteered Chinatown Afterschool Program at PBHA. I tutored grade 5 students from Boston Chinatown and helped planned weekly projects that were implemented for academic enrichment for the kids. We also helped the students in the spring semester to prepare for the ISEE test. During this time, I also served as grade coordinator. 

Summer 2013: I volunteered at Summerbridge Hong Kong again as a committee head in addition to being a student-teacher. I was responsible for planning a special event that welcomed 200 students into the summer program within a week. As a student-teacher, I planned my lessons and taught architecture history to a class of 14 students. 

Academic Year 2013: I continued volunteering at Chinatown Afterschool Program to tutor grade 6 students. I also became a Bureau of Study Counsel tutor for Gov 20. ]]></Q6.2>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[One strength I think I have in leading a group of first-year student is my experience in the classroom and in coordinating people. My experience as a teacher and tutor in the classroom equipped me with effective communication skills and helped me build a patient, sensitive, and understanding character. These traits are important to being a good leader and also to managing interpersonal dynamics. Furthermore, these education-related experiences enable me to be a good teacher (of course, in reality, the teaching relationship in FOP is mutual), which is essential to helping the first-year students to better transition into college as well as to enjoy their time during FOP. My experience as a coordinator also equipped me with the skill of delegating tasks and making sure that each individual feels involved. I think that these characteristics can aid me in leading and interacting with a group of freshmen over a sustained period of time.

		<Q7.3>As an international student, I sometimes find myself in a situation where I find it difficult to relate to my friends in college, especially during my first semester. This, in the context of FOP, may pose as a challenge to me as part of my role as a FOP leader is also to help FOPers transition into college life in a manageable fashion. If I am unable to sympathize with their experiences and emotions, then I cannot effectively help them transition into college. However, over the past year, I have found myself increasingly capable of understanding my friends here. I began to understand better what their experiences were, and have become more and more able to share their feelings. Furthermore, I have also found that my background can also connect me with my friends in many different ways. No longer do we have to bond over our similarities; we become able to bond over our differences as well.

Another significant challenge that I foresee is my lack of experience in the remote outdoors. While I have gone on hiking trips before, I have never spent an extended period in the outdoors, and so I may not be capable of addressing all the problems that the students may have for me. However, I am dedicated to learning these skills to best equip myself to be a FOP leader.

		<Q7.4>One day in the fall semester of my last year of high school, my friends and I decided that we would backpack together in China over winter break. The idea came spontaneously, and we all were excited at the prospect of traveling together. We started planning the trip, making all the accommodation arrangement, figuring out how to buy train tickets once in China, and checking the weather, etc. 

However, soon that I expected it was already winter break, and I realized I had yet to finish my college applications. I previously imagined that I would have finished all essays well before we would leave for China. Yet, two days before the departure date, I was still working on my third application only. The dilemma hit me with such urgency that I was thinking of quitting the trip.

Yet, a part of me refused to let go of the plan. I knew that I would regret not having gone on the trip later on. I was also reminded of the fact that the trip was planned by everyone for everyone. Ditching my friends at the last minute would be irresponsible. I needed to convince myself to not quit, which I did after I realized that I had the choice to strike a balance between traveling and writing applications. And as I look back now, I am glad that I made that decision. 
</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The first concern is the fact that Peter announced that there is a competition, and the subsequent impact it may have on the FOPers. There are two possible kinds of impact that I can imagine. The first is that in trying to win the competition our FOPers may compromise their safety. Often times, when people are in a competitive mode, they prioritize expediency over everything else, including safety, which in the context of FOP should always be the number one concern. Moreover, in trying to set the tarp up quickly, they may easily miss important steps or fail to make a sturdy tarp. Both of these outcomes can cause safety problems. The second type of impact is more psychological; that is, what the emotional impact when a team wins and another loses in such a competition may be. In particular, given the dynamics of the FOPers as described, it seems that there already exists tensions in FOPers’ relationship with one another (this will be explained further). To add to this dynamics a win-lose result from the competition would be against the purpose of FOP. In order to handle this, I will talk to Peter and discuss these concerns with him. If possible, I will try to convince him to change the plan, and emphasize the collectivistic nature of the trip and prioritize bonding and safety over competition and speed. 

The second concern is how the group dynamics among the FOPers are playing out. As I mentioned earlier, it seems like some FOPers and their self-perception are under pressure. This, it seems, is caused by FOPers comparing themselves to others, and feeling inadequate as a result, especially as many FOPers in this case have had many unique and rare experiences. One obvious example in this case is Renee, but she is no by means the only one. Daniel, for example, may also be feeling this kind of pressure. Other kinds of tensions are also present, such as that between Phillip and Peter. These tensions and pressures on each person’s self-perception and interpersonal relationships need to be resolved in order for the rest of the trip to be enjoyable to everyone. To do so, I think having a brief group sharing session that night before everyone goes to sleep can be a good idea. It can encourage each FOPer to share what they feel, and address some of the tensions I discussed here. If it goes well, it might even become a bonding activity. 

The last pressing concern is the weather. The fact that there was a thunderstorm may mean that the weather can worsen in the upcoming days. While there is not much that can be done about the weather, I will keep watching out for changes in the weather, and discuss with Peter if there needs to be changed made to the plan.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Coming into FOP this year, I was terrified of what Harvard would be like. Coming from a small town public school, I knew that I was not afforded many of the advantages my peers had and I felt extremely apprehensive as a result. By the end of my trip, however, I was no longer scared of what the next four years would hold, but I was excited to experience Harvard and see the impact I could make on campus. My FOP family really helped me to reach this point and feel like a true part of the Harvard community. 
	Building from this experience, I feel like I could really connect with nervous first year students on a personal level, as FOP was such an important experience in my college transition and still plays a large role in my college life today. I understand the importance of the openness between FOP participants and the trust and vulnerability necessary to achieve this level of community and family. I think that I would be good at communicating my experiences and leading the way toward a total group unity and family atmosphere.
	Also, having run a marathon this November and based on my fitness level and wilderness experience, I would also be able to physically lead a trip and help others through the physical aspects without a problem. I really enjoy physical challenges, and got both of my sisters into running—to the point where each of them has completed a half marathon. So I am excited about hiking in the woods, but I am even more excited to share and spread my love of the outdoors and physical activity with others.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I have always been known as leader in my local community, but personally, I feel that I have always led by example. I am not very outspoken in general—I believe that actions speak louder than words. While this may be effective in some situations, I feel that I will need to be more outspoken to lead a FOP trip. Coming out of my shell more and being more comfortable in a demanding leadership role will certainly be difficult, but it is something that I can work on and develop to become better at.
	I have never been very comfortable doing the energizer exercises and similar activities. I know that this is something that I can get better at with time and practice, and I plan on really trying to develop those excitable skills to help with the FOP experience. While I have never been a particularly open person either, I was able to open up to my FOP group this year about a lot of personal experiences that I had not previously shared with very many people. Going forward, I feel that this openness is a crucial part of the FOP experience, and while it is not a strength of mine, I feel that it is something that I have actually gotten better with recently. I can overcome this and open up to the group—showing others that it is also okay to trust and share.

		<Q7.4>My father and I were riding four wheelers through the woods when he lost control of his machine and fell off, with it subsequently flipping over onto him and effectively breaking his back. The first decision I had to face was how and whether I should move the flipped machine off of him. At that point, all logic aside, I just really needed to see that he was okay, so I managed to pick it up off of him and flip it over. Next, I had to decide how to get him medical help and how much help he needed. My father was lying on the ground, and I was completely alone with him in the middle of the woods. I made sure he could move all of his appendages first and made the decision that he physically could not get up and I would not be able to ride him back on my machine. As a result, the next thing I did was call 911, as fortunately, I had both a cell phone and cell phone reception. From that point forward, I was in contact with the dispatcher and was able to guide the ambulance to the nearest trailhead, from which we walked a backboard over to my dad and were able to carry him over to the ambulance. While looking back on the situation, many of the decisions I made now seem like obvious choices, but thinking clearly in a crisis like that is not easy. </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The fact that Renee has become standoffish as a result of Lizzie and Matilda’s conversations concerns me. I can empathize, also coming from a small town, and I would try to reach out to Renee. Although she is talking less, I would make a concerted effort to try and connect with her on a personal level and make sure that she feels included in the group. Furthermore, I would try to become a part of Lizzie and Matilda’s conversations as well. I would try to connect with them and steer their conversations in a more common direction so that Renee could interact with them. I feel like trying to protect Renee and confronting Lizzie and Matilda about their unknowingly insensitive conversations would not only be embarrassing to Renee but could also damage her status within the group. Thus, I would attempt to personally connect with all three of them and try to steer their conversations back in a more accepting direction. 
The fact that Mark is carrying the gear of others as well as most of the group gear concerns me. While he physically may be able to handle it, he is unnecessarily putting himself in a potentially dangerous position. Carrying more gear will increase fatigue and this fatigue can add up over the trip, putting him at risk for a fatigue related injury. Additionally, allowing him to carry so much does not coincide with the principles of FOP in my eyes. FOP should be an experience about surviving and living together, as a group, in the woods. Each person should carry their own weight and experience the burdens of the trip and make these sacrifices for the greater good of the group. By allowing Mark to take more gear, others are also not carrying their fair share, and this does not teach them the importance of the true interdependence present on a FOP trip.
Finally, the behavior of both Phillip and Peter concerns me. Phillip seems to be pretentious and even borderline mean to Daniel. I do not find this to be an acceptable behavior, but, at the same time, I do not believe that it would be my place to step in and confront Phillip about this. Instead, I would attempt to talk to Phillip about things that Daniel can relate to as well and try and help facilitate their friendship. Finally, Peter seems to be encouraging Phillip’s behavior. I do not think that FOPpers should be talking to leaders most—they should be interacting with fellow FOPpers. I would bring this point up to Peter the next time we were alone and see what his opinion is on the matter. I would definitely communicate the fact that Phillip seems to be attached to him too much and listen to his opinion on the matter. I would attempt to get him to scale back his interactions with Phillip overall, though.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Entering Harvard as a freshman I had two major concerns: 1) would I make friends and 2) would I find activities that I love. I am happy to say that, now a sophomore, I was able to accomplish both of these tasks, but it wasn’t without much self-exploration and a lot of experimentation. I have tried everything from Crew to Financial Clubs to Premed societies, and in the process have come to understand and appreciate all that Harvard has to offer to its diverse population. I think my knowledge of the many different faces of Harvard, be it arts, athletics, occupational preparation, or otherwise, has prepared me to serve as a resource for incoming students who may have the same concerns I had. 
	
Aside from my varied background in extracurriculars, I have also amassed a great deal of leadership experience both before and during my time at Harvard that I think would really aid in my ability to guide a group of freshman. During my time in these leadership roles, I have learned that one of the most important things a leader can do is support inter-group camaraderie in order for group members to get the most out of an experience. I think I have substantial experience in this area and that I’d be able to not only lead a group of first-years, but lead a group of friends. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I would say the greatest challenge I foresee would be overcoming my hesitance to delegate responsibility. I like having my hands in everything, partly because I like doing things a particular way. From what I understand, FOP is largely a practice in trust and teamwork, so I would work my hardest to delegate responsibility and trust that certain tasks get accomplished properly even if I don’t have a direct hand in their completion. I know personally I get aggravated when people try to micromanage tasks I am assigned, so I will definitely work to not do that. 

I’m also particularly terrible with remembering names, so I would definitely incorporate some sort of name game right at the beginning of the program so I can not only build a sense of community within the group from the get go but also so I can put names to faces so I don’t forget a group member’s name (what’s worse for trust-building than forgetting someone’s name!).
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Class selection is a particularly stressful time for me because, being a science concentrator, there is always the need to find a balance between necessary science courses and fun electives. At the beginning of this semester, I was a bit overzealous and signed up for five classes, three science classes, Chinese, and Greek. As the semester approached its fifth week, my workload quickly increased to an unbearable level, and I was forced to make the difficult decision to drop a class. But which one? Yes, dropping Greek made the most sense since I got very little out of it, but I liked the professor and my family wanted me to continue my education in the language of our homeland. Also, the prospect of three science classes and Chinese, which in itself is very scientific, scared me. But I couldn’t help but think about the future, how taking these classes now would free me from them later. It took me until the last possible day before I ultimately dropped Greek. I think I made the right decision, but I often question it when I’m buried in psets and vocabulary. In retrospect, I wish I had taken my mental health into greater consideration, because I love science, but I also love reading and writing and being creative. Perhaps the real decision wasn’t between dropping Greek or a science course, but rather between taking up a different course altogether, one that stimulated me in a non-scientific way. There’s always next semester.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The most pressing concern I have is Kelly’s health. When you are in the middle of the woods, you need to be extra sensitive to illness because help is often hours away. The fact that she is shivering coupled with her tendency to give away her sweet snacks could potentially point to an eating disorder, but I would not jump to that decision too quickly. I would have a private conversation with Kelly just to gauge how she is feeling and try to explain to her that her shivering could potentially be a side effect from overexertion and that the quickest fix for that is  to replenish her energy stores by eating more. In this way, the point is not “you’re sick because you’re not eating”, but “you can get better by eating more.” If her health continued to decline, I would look for ways to get her to a doctor for a thorough evaluation even if she says she’s fine. 

The next concern I have is Renee’s lack of socialization. Student’s come on this trip to make friends and have fun, and if a group member is not meeting these goals then it is my responsibility to step in and help. I would first engage Renee is conversation that required more than a one or two word answer. After I got some information out of her (interests, hobbies, etc.), I would try to see if anything she mentioned could be inserted into any conversations I hear between other group members. After all, it is important that there is dialogue between the freshman as opposed to solely between a freshman and a leader. Depending on how receptive Lizzie and Matilda are to accepting Renee into conversation, I would try to get Renee to interact with some different students (maybe Kelly or Jack) who might share some more similar interests with her. 

I also take great concern with the way in which my co-leader Peter is handling Phillip. It is definitely not okay for a leader to roll his eyes at a group member’s stories, no matter how annoying, because we are their to serve as the group’s uniting forces. If Phillip were to see Peter rolling his eyes, his experience could be seriously affected, which is unfair. I would privately talk to Peter and casually mention that I saw him roll his eyes at Peter and that it’s not really appropriate for us to be doing that since we are there to make the freshman feel comfortable. To help get Phillip off of Peter’s back, however, I would try to engage him in conversation and help him see that, although he is a year older than the others, he may still share similar ideas and values with them.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[The mistakes I have made during the first year and half of college would be my most valuable source of leadership.  This semester in particular, I have spent a fair amount of time analyzing how college has changed my priorities–for better and worse–and what I would like to consciously change in the future.  I am aware the most would like to have done things differently in college, even if only a little bit, and that what each person wants to change is completely different. I would not expect FOPers to have the same mistakes or desires that I do. However, I believe I could gain the trust of first-years by explaining to them my thought-process.  

While this would hopefully allow me to establish a rapport, I also believe that I feel confident enough in an outdoor setting to remain calm if anything goes wrong.  I imagine it is tough for a group of freshmen to place full trust in someone only a year or two older than them.  Having gone on enough poorly planned trips (often with only people my age), I understand it is not the end of the world if you make camp many hours later than expected or if half your warm clothes get wet.  I would strive to impart a sense of calm throughout the whole trip, and remind people that the outdoors setting is a medium for reflection and preparation, and need not be a source of stress, even during seemingly dire circumstances.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[On my FOP trip I found it hard to open up in the same way as the other 8 FOPers.   I struggled to articulate if I were tired, hungry, sad, happy, confused,  or nervous when.  When we sat and talked each evening it seemed I was often the last to speak.  I remember feeling self-consicous about sharing details (both good and bad) of my life prior to coming to Harvard, and marveled how some of my FOPmates were so comfortable sharing what I thought may be intimate things about high school or family and friends.  I would sit and listen intently, but rarely talk in the same manner. While this may make me a good listener, it may also make it more difficult for me to be honest about my experiences at Harvard.  I would not want this stage-fright make it so that I paint an inaccurate picture of what is ahead.  I want my FOPers to be both prepared and excited for the year ahead.  For this to happen I need them to finishing FOP excited to join wonderful place;  a place that is not without it's struggles but also with ample support and wisdom available to them.

My hope is that my experience living in close proximity with roommates has made me a much more open person.  I also believe that I am more willing to share when I am sharing with a group have are about to have a common experience with me. 
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>Two summers ago I was rock climbing with a friend when we got way above our heads. I am a very weak climber and so is he. I ran into trouble as soon as I started on the first pitch.  There seemed to be almost nowhere suitable for me to place protection and save myself from hitting the ground were I to fall.  The entire way up I was terrified and a majority of the time I would have hit a ledge had I fallen.

My friend followed after me.  He fell twice, but my anchor at the top meant he only swung on the rope.  When he joined me on my ledge however, I faced the decision whether or not to continue.  I know we both wanted very badly to keep climbing.  We had lots of daylight left and good weather and wanted to check this climb of our list. However, I soon realized I had not prepared properly for this full multi-pitch climb.  I had managed not to fall on the first pitch, but was that just luck?  I also had to consider the abilities of my friend, who had already fallen twice. If he fell or got stuck on the next pitch our situation would be far worse than simply a failed climb.  I knew  my technical skill was rusty at best and did not want to give my friend a false impression of my abilities.

So we repelled off from that ledge and went swimming.
</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The first of my three concerns is the well being of Kelly.  There are a lot things to work on with this group, but the physical health and safety of a FOPer is paramount.  Seeing her shivering multiple times during breaks is a warning sign.  The real problem is that she just brushes it off, saying that she “is fine and just needs to keep hiking.”  This indicates to me that she is unwilling to tell anyone if she is physically uncomfortable and even prefers to hide it.  It makes me question whether she is just being nice when she gives away all her desserts.  It worries me most that a FOPper is not comfortable to talk to her leaders when there is a problem directly dealing with physical or mental health.

Next, I am worried about Peter’s behavior tonight.  Two things in particular worry me.  First, that he is trying to make a competition out of setting up tarps.  I believe this is very much the wrong way to go about such an important task.  Making tarps into a competition is dangerous in that people may become careless about where they choose to set up tarps (away from widow-makers branches, depressions where water might collect if it rains, etc.) or how they set them up (tight lines, good knots, etc.).  This puts people and property at risk simply for the sake of a game.  Secondly, if we as a co-leader pair are trying for group harmony, pitting the kids against eachother in a competition at the end of a long day is counterproductive.

Peter’s mention of the Gage Caves is also inappropriate.  The problem is that his statement implies that it’s fine for a FOPper to be by themself a quarter mile from camp, which I imagine is not OK in the first place.  Furthermore, if we as co-leaders wanted to keep people away from caves (a classically tempting thing to explore), it is foolish to mention them at all and run the risk that someone curious might run off to explore them.

My third concern is Suzy and Mark. While I’m glad to see the enjoy each others company, the ‘no hop on fop’ policy is in place for a reason.  I believe that if two of my FOPpers were to have a relationship beyond that of FOPper and fellow FOPper, the dynamic of the entire group is changed for the worse.  I want all my FOPpers to feel equal and comfortable around each other, and if two of them pair off, this is a hard to feeling to achieve.  A freshmen in their first week may feel uncomfortable sharing a tent with a new couple or may feel marginalized while hiking with the two of them.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[I'm going to fuse the two possible responses, since a lot of my experience with the outdoors is more leisurely in nature (no pun intended). 

I have gone on many smaller hiking trips (typically ~2.5 hrs- full day) throughout my child/teenhood. These include:

July 2013: Full day hike from a local village near Mukteshwar to Mukteshwar, Uttarkhand, India. I was a team member who assisted in orientation and getting food along the way. 

Summer 2010: Walked through Arcadia national park in Bar Harbor, ME with family. Was an excited participant. 

Summer 2009: Several day-trips hiking trails in the Pacific Northwest (Washington State, Pacific Coast in Canada), also with family. Also an excited participant!

June 2008: Hiking trails in Glacier National Park (Montana) and Grand Teton National Park (Wyoming). See: excited participant.

~June 2005: Rafting in Nevada with my family. Was the first time I've ever done something like that, and although it was a while ago, something I still remember. Would love to go again. Was a paddler on the team led by my father. 

All through my childhood young adulthood: Went on walks with my father in the local forest where we mushroom scouted, and learned a good thing or two about mushrooms. Also learned to canoe in the waters around my hometown. 

Having looked back on these experiences, I think a common denominator in my exposure to nature when growing up was frequency (at least relative to most of suburban Long Island) and unbridled love for its various domains, but a flirtatiously insubstantial relationship with it. That being said, I think that the first two components of that common denominator have convinced me that it's time to fix up the third; particularly the hiking trip in India--which took place with a group of non-family members, was long and grueling by my relatively naive standards (several hours right uphill), and took place in an exciting, brand new context (it was my first time in India and Uttarakhand)--made me want to gain the endurance, tenacity, and community that comes with group backpacking/hiking. I'd say THAT most definitively planted the seed of applying-to-be-a-FOP-Leader in me.

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Teaching: 
-June 2008 and 2009: Volunteer and then staff member at Camp Chaverim, a camp for children with special needs in Oceanside, New York. Worked with kids in several areas of academic and social development. Worked with kids with different needs ranging from autism spectrum disorders to learning disabilities.The most meaningful (combined) 10 weeks of my life.

-Fall 2012-Present: Counselor and Coordinator for Mission Hill After School Program (MHASP). Led a classroom of 13 kids in academic and social activities through curricula of my group's design. Worked alongside a team of awesome staff members--who continually inspire me through their patience, insight, and empathy-- while doing it.

-March 2013: Volunteered at the Dandelion School in Beijing, China, where I taught English and a curriculum about music history. Also worked with an amazing staff in a very exciting and different cultural context. 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________
Non-teaching:

Thespian Editor, Oceanside High School Troupe #132: Helped manage a troupe through a rehearsal process for our self-directed show, and coordinate certain theatre related events. 

Treasurer, World Interest Club: Helped logistically organize my Model UN's trips to Brown, Harvard, and George Washington University. Worked one on one with kids to help research, prepare them to speak in front of large committees, and just generally elicit self-confidence from within. Our Model UN team was ranked in the top 15 in the country that year, and just generally, it was a very rewarding experience as a function of the interpersonal skills I gained.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think like a child. When I was in India, one of my favorite things to do was to learn the names of the stops on the Delhi metro and mimic the automated voice. Or to get lost walking around the local park for a few hours, or go to see a movie in Hindi (even though I don't speak a word). I think that this mentality carries forward into the way that I try and engage with others. In an ideal world, for example, I'd move no conversational gambits; the first question that I'd ask a person is what song means the most to them, simply because that's what the curious child in me wants to know. My desire to approach people with no pretense boils down to the “childlike” idea that we're all people who, in the end, are chasing the simple goal of a meaningful experience on earth; to that end I neither take myself, nor anyone else, too seriously.

I also work really well under pressure. One time, my then girlfriend's car got stuck on a beach because we drove too far off the pavement. She freaked out, and, while I notoriously worry a lot (see below), I realized that worrying would just not really do much to improve the situation. Eventually, we called a towing company and the situation was settled without much incident. In the event an emergency comes up, I trust myself to make rational decisions under the gun.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[Shutting off the anxiety that comes with the desire to create an awesome experience for the incoming freshman. I do worry a lot; it's something I've worked on, but it was big fuel for me in high school and I'll admit that there are vestiges of an old David that actively inhabit my current person. Particularly in the realm of how I appear to others, as I so critically lacked the confidence that my, at times, zaniness will be received well. I think that between being in India and working in MHASP, I learned that openness to my feelings, even if they are "bad" ones, and patience can jointly open me to being the child that I really am. So much of my anxiety came from trying to stifle what are really natural inclinations for a person to have; time and acceptance worked wonders in alleviating it. Despite the fact that I feel that this semester I've been able to be around others with less internal melodrama than ever before, FOP will be a totally new experience that involves a leadership-intimacy that I've never engaged in before. With that comes the fear that THAT David will resurface. 

I can also see myself being zealous about certain facets of the Harvard experience, and don't want to represent Harvard students or myself in a manner unbecoming of either. I think, for example, that I’m jaded about aspects of job searches/careers and don’t want to scare freshman off with that mentality. 
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[My parents were coming to visit Cambridge on September 27th, and Mike and I began seeing each other on the 20th. In a serendipitous turn of events, my mother asked me to take a walk with her to deliver something to a friend in the Square. This was my chance, and in about 5 minutes (the duration of that walk) I had to decide whether to tell her. 

It was a battle of two equally heavy weights on a scale. On one hand, there was this burning desire to share with my mother, the woman that I loved the most, one of the happiest turns in my life; on the other hand, the tugging of a preconceived idea that I would only tell my parents if it got very serious (i.e., dating for more than seven days). On one hand, there was a matter of principle-- if this was a girl I was dating, I'd totally tell my mom, so what made this different? On the other, my father's words resounding words from the day I got into Harvard--"Now, all you have to do is marry a Jewish girl and my trip to America is worth it"—confirmed that that just wasn't the case. It wasn't a standard gut-brain divide: both of them, individually, were pretty divided.

I ended up telling her: I had to trust her, and I had to trust that things would work out. Trust, I learned, transcends most analyses. It certainly did with my mother. 
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first priority is physical wellness of all the FOPpers, and I think that there is reason to believe that Kelly is feeling ill: shivering and eating poorly are not good indicators of wellness. She might be shy to speak up as a function of not wanting to hold the group back or not being perceived a burden; to that end, I think the best strategy is to pull her aside without “pulling her aside” by asking her to help me clean up. At that time, I’d encourage her to think of whatever she maybe POTENTIALLY (being sure to clarify that I am not accusing her of lying earlier) going through—be it something “out of her control”, like viral infection or “in her control”, like physical exhaustion—as not being her fault: even if she has done trips of this nature before, this is a unique set of circumstances that could elicit a reaction altogether different than anything she’s previously felt. I would emphasize that that FOPpers have fallen ill before, she shouldn’t feel bashful about letting me know if she’s feeling unwell, and that there’s a contingency plan in place to help her if need be. 

The situation with Lizzie, Matilda, and Renee is more difficult to address. Coming to Harvard I always thought there would be a class divide and that I’d never befriend people who came from a “higher class” than me; that is patently not the case, and it’s a personal peeve of mine to see people intimidated, or in anyway held back, by their background (although their feelings are certainly natural). I would love to do a circle around the fire and ask the FOPpers point blank, “What have been the most exciting, and challenging parts of getting to know new people on this trip?” and, as a logical extension, “What are some things that you think may be challenging and exciting about Harvard?”, emphasizing, and encouraging everyone to consider, that this is a safe space. One of the largest lessons about leadership that I learned from MHASP is that the best leaders cultivate an environment for self-reflection, but avoid imputing their reflections or ideas onto others. While this circle doesn’t hit the nail right on the head, I think it combines sensitivity and openness in the best way possible.

Finally, I think it’s important to have a conversation with Peter. Obviously, a few things went wrong today: the idea of putting up tents quickly as a contest at the expense of putting them up carefully, for example, is problematic to me. That being said, I know I probably haven’t been the perfect leader either. I’d approach Peter before the next day of travel began and ask him first to point out anything that I did that he felt I could improve on—phrasing it just as such—with the expectation that he could allow me to do the same. I’d primarily use “I think” statements, as opposed to “You should” statements, to avoid imputing my values on to him as much as humanly possible. ]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1>FOP was my first real experience doing anything substantive in the outdoors. I am from Houston, Texas, where there doesn't exist much of an environment for hiking or canoeing. I loved hiking through the mountains on FOP because its something I have never experienced before at any other time in my life. Along with being extremely exciting and new, FOP was also very relaxing for me. Being cut off from all electronics with such beautiful surroundings was refreshing. I would love to become more familiar with backcountry skills as a FOP leader but also for my own benefit for when I spend more time hiking in the future. </Q6.1>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think my strengths as a FOP leader would come from what I have experienced so far coming to Harvard. While understanding the complexities of Harvard certainly is a task to overcome, I found that the greatest obstacle for me was creating connections with a completely new group of people while adjusting to a completely different atmosphere. My greatest strength is that I understand the uncertainty that can come from not only meeting a ton of new people, but also moving to a new place hundreds of miles away from home that’s completely different in every way. As a FOP leader I would strive to relate my transition to Harvard to the freshman I lead on a FOP trip to help make them feel more comfortable in their own transition. Additionally, I think a FOP leader should be someone who is personable and can actively engage everyone in the FOP group. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[Drawing on my experiences as a FOP participant, I think the greatest challenge I would face in leading a group of first-year students would be making every single individual in the group I’m leading feel included, important, and a sense of belonging. I can distinctly remember on my second night of FOP last August feeling intensely out of place. That feeling dissipated by the end of my trip as I got to more genuinely know my leaders and the other freshman on my trip. I think it’s important to actively include every member of the trip in discussions and activities and never discount someone’s opinion or feelings regardless of the situation. I cite this as a challenge because groups can be unpredictable in how they interact with each other. Its imperative that leaders set a positive and inclusive tone for the trip, reaching out to every individual throughout the experience. Harvard can seem like, and often can actually be an intimidating place.  FOP is such a special program because it allows people from all backgrounds to form bonds and connections that otherwise might not form. Feeling as though you already have a group of people surrounding you and supporting you days before you even begin your education at Harvard made me and I hope it will make the FOPpers I lead feel as though they belong at Harvard.  ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Throughout high school I spent the majority of my time doing one activity in many different forms, playing the bassoon. I played in multiple youth orchestras and high school ensembles, and the pinnacle of any Texas High School musicians “career” was making the All-State ensemble. The process involved many different auditions and stages, culminating in one final audition that determined whether or not you were chosen or not. My sophomore year of high school I had practiced for hours on end to achieve this goal and I finally qualified for the pinnacle audition before All-State. A few weeks before the audition my great-grandparents announced that they were taking our whole extended family on a family reunion trip. Seeing my extended family was a rare occurrence considering that they lived in Utah and Colorado. This seems like a very privileged dilemma, but I had worked extremely hard for this audition, yet I hadn’t seen my cousins in years. If I decided to stay home, I would be home alone for an entire week and would embark on the audition alone while my family was out of connection in the Caribbean. If I decided to go on the trip I would simply give up my chance to audition. I finally decided to skip out on the trip and audition because the work I had put in was greater than any other pursuit in my life. I ended up not doing well in the audition, but my conviction to my passion throughout the process solidified my commitment I had to something I worked tirelessly for.  ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern that I notice in this scenario is the dynamic between Lizzie and Matilda in relation to Renee. It seems clear that Renee feels uncomfortable relating to the extravagant stories that are being told by Lizzie and Matilda. Harvard is a place of extreme diversity, shown both politically and socioeconomically. I think it’s important as a FOP leader to reach out to Renee and try to understand how she is feeling at this point in the trip and try to make her feel more comfortable. As FOP leaders, we should make sure that nobody feels uncomfortable or less than important as a member of the group. I think this situation would benefit from the autobiography exercise that we did on my own FOP trip. That exercise really helped everyone in the group understand where everyone is coming in their transition to Harvard beyond just geography. 

Another concern I see in this situation is how Kelly is behaving.  Her shivering has me concerned over her health and well-being. The scenario explains that after speaking with her she says she’s fine and just needs to continue hiking. This makes the situation even more difficult. I think to mediate this situation I would make a recommendation to the entire group saying that the weather is getting colder and that I would like to see everyone put on an extra layer. This way, I think Kelly wouldn’t feel like an outlier in her response to the weather. If, after making this recommendation, Kelly is still shivering and still doesn’t put on an extra layer, I think it would be time to individually speak to her about the concern I have about her safety, and that I only want her to be healthy. 

I think that it’s important that FOP leaders maintain positivity and inclusiveness throughout the entire FOP experience no matter the circumstances. For some people, this is completely different from anything they have ever experienced before. Phillips dynamic with the group might lead to an alienation of sorts with some group members. I think its important to remain interested in what someone like Phillip has to say, without making it seem like you are giving him special privilege. I also think its important that you make sure everyone in the group is interacting with each other. On my FOP trip we did partner hiking to get to know everyone on the trip. I wouldn’t immediately address my co-leader about his eye rolling, but I certainly would be attentive to it, and possibly reinforce to him our roles as positive role models if I saw it happen again.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[- Every Summer: Family Vacations - Linville, NC (Blue Ridge Mountains). Every summer, for about two weeks, my family travels to the mountains of North Carolina. While there we hike four or five times a week. These hikes are between two and six miles, and some include significant elevation change. These are all day hikes. I play no specific organizational role, but I am responsible for my own food, water, and layers, as well as providing input regarding routes.

- Fall 2011: Alternative Physical Education (Berkshire County, MA). For a P.E. credit in my senior year of high school, I participated in Alternative P.E.  Instead of meeting every day for a semester, we had five, one-day long trips throughout the semester: indoor rock climbing, downhill skiing, hiking, hiking/canoeing (min switch trip), and a day at our local gym. Our day hike took place at Mt. Frissell, and the mini switch trip was on Goose Pond and a section of the AT in Berkshire County. Again, I played no organizational role but provided for myself and was a very enthusiastic participant.


- August 2012: FOP Switch Trip (Maine). I participated in a switch trip with my fearless leaders and new-found friends freshman fall. This was my first overnight experience.

- Life: Growing up in the beautiful Berkshires I’ve spent a great deal of time outdoors. Growing up, my parents took us hiking, biking, canoeing, cross-country skiing and kayaking regularly. Over the years I have gained familiarity with being outdoors, reading trail markers, following poorly marked trails, staying with a group, maintaining a positive group dynamic, and general safety principles. I have yet to hold any formal leadership positions in this context, but am eager to learn that which will make me fit to do so.
]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[High School Athletics: 
2011 - I was a captain of my Varsity Soccer Team. This leadership role, in a group setting, was an opportunity to face the challenges that rise in trying to maintain a group dynamic conducive to high-level competition and a positive collective experience.
2012 - I was a captain of the Track and Field team. Injured for the first portion of the season, I helped coach. As a captain I was particularly aware of the discontinuity that is present on such a large team, and we made a concerted effort to make sure all felt included. 

Teachers’ Assistant – Fact and Fiction, 2011-2012
For the first semester of my senior year I was a teachers’ assistant for the tenth grade honors combined English and History course “Fact and Fiction.” This team-taught course covers American Literature and History. As an assistant to the two teachers I provided insight in class discussion, helped grade quizzes, and work closely with students in the essay writing process. I also led the class discussions and presented on background material daily for one unit.

MMRHS Student Senate – Executive Conference Vice-President (2011-2012) and Executive Conference Treasurer (2010-2011)
As a member of student government I played an integral role in initiating, organizing, and facilitating many school-wide events. Among these were micro-forums in which students discussed our school culture and our master schedule, school-wide spirit activities (Spirit Week and Chill on the Hill), and organizing student volunteers for our school’s ten year tribute to 9/11. I also served as a student representative to the MMRHS Parent Council, the BHRSD School Committee and the BHRSD Anti-Bullying Committee. 

Berkshire Soccer School - Counselor for two one-week sessions of camp for 5- to 14-year-old players. (2009 - 2011) I generally worked with older campers (9 and up). I was responsible for running stations or traveling to stations with a certain group.			
Volunteer coach for Berkshire Hills Youth Soccer teams. (2011)
Volunteer referee at the annual "Monument Cup" 3 vs. 3 Youth Soccer Tournament. (2009-2011)
Massachusetts State Referee (2012) Received training and certification to be a referee. We spent a lot of time considering decision making in time-sensitive situations, and keeping people safe while playing hard.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[While I have no additional formal teaching experience, or extensive additional outdoor experience (other than being stuck on a small island during a lightning storm) I have grown immensely as a person and have become an avid communicator about the issues I hold near and dear. This has sprung from a recognition of the fundamental importance of open communication in making the difficult situations in life processable and therefore bearable, if not embraceable and enjoyable. I have been able to begin building the community at Harvard that will best serve me and allowed me to help others do the same. I’ve applied myself to getting to know myself better and to accept my flaws and issues as opportunities to grow stronger and become better for myself and others. I feel like I am learning about myself every day and by communicating about this I am a teacher of myself. In these conversations I learn about others and consequentially learn even more about myself. This has been an exceptionally rewarding experience. I have always believed in the power of human connection, but more than ever before I am seeing it play out in a way that I imagine having a lasting impact in my life and the lives of those around me. I feel more passionate than ever before about the value I am adding to the lives of others by encouraging them not to discount themselves. And I feel more passionate than ever about wanting the opportunity to be a FOP leader. In a relatively implicit way FOP was my introduction to open communication and self-recognition. I learned skills that prepared me to tackle tough situations and put me in the path of people who could help my through them. One of my leaders continues to play an important role in helping me process my experiences by talking about them, but also by listening to his experiences. If I can add to others lives what he and other FOP people have added to mine I would consider that an exceptionally rewarding opportunity to grow and to help others grow. ]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[One of the aspects of my personality that has developed into an amazing strength is my honesty and openness with myself and others, and from this I’ve become more compassionate than ever before. These are characteristics that I have seen in others, including my FOP leader and recognized as crucial for making my time at Harvard and my life in general as successful as I want it to be. I also believe these characteristics, and they way they interplay, to be exceptionally replicable and in presenting myself as myself in a way that is honest and genuine others see the opportunity to open up and do the same. This then paves the way for increased understanding of others and builds a cycle that brings people to better understanding their own self. With increased honesty and openness, understanding becomes possible and through understanding we can’t help but be compassionate not only to ourselves, but also towards others. I, as a FOP leader, would help open the door for the type of conversations that allow people to become better versions of their selves and better members of a community by engaging in discussions in a healthy way that promotes caring.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>My greatest challenge would be in making sure I was only guiding and steering the development of group dynamic. I have a tendency to feel I understand how groups can work well and try to act on them. But the truth is that there are often many ways a group could work well and develop. It could need some more direct help getting to one of those points and that's where leaders can use their role to manipulate dynamics rather than facilitating a structure that allows for natural group dynamics to develop. 
It is easy for me to see the ways others could be better and the ways that a group could be better, but it is important to me to realize that the betterment is best for the individual or group if it comes from within rather than coming form the outside as an imposition. But since I am a part of the group I do have the opportunity to effect change within the group. The most difficult thing will for me to be patient in helping the dynamic shift and grow, but it is something I am capable of so long as I and my co-leader hold each other accountable for our role in the group.
</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[In my freshman year of college I made a very difficult decision that I view as having set me up to have the greatest chance of success possible while at Harvard and beyond. In the first week, before classes had even started, I recognized that I was extremely anxious about my allergies and from this anxiety I was drawing into myself, not letting myself trust others and developing OCD-like habits that furthered my anxiety as I became aware of how others were perceiving my behavior as odd. With that, I went to MHS and started talking to a therapist. Before going, I considered whether I had the right to do so, whether my problem was big enough. But I also considered how unbearable the year would be if I could not move beyond the state I was in to a better mental state. I knew I needed help, so I took that step. Over the course of the year I made many improvements but it was not until the summer that I uninstalled the habits I had developed. In returning to school, knowing how far I had come with my anxiety issues, I was distraught to realize Harvard was still a really hard place to be, and that it didn't feel like myself. I was embarrassed by my emotions and inability to handle what so many others seemed to do. But after a week or so of being incredibly down, I again sought help and realized that in peeling away my anxiety issues I had revealed an even realer part of myself which was depression. Had I not made the decision freshman year to seek help, I certainly wouldn’t have been able to do so as easily my sophomore year. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first step would be to consult with Peter, and see what he is noticing with regards to the group dynamics. If he is not seeing the same issues as I, it will be important to be on the same page about what is going on before taking steps to create a more positive group dynamic. Assuming he is on the same page, I would suggest we do the following:
Over breakfast I would encourage discussion to move away from past experiences and into potential interests while at Harvard. This could obviously create more imbalances in terms of who has done much forward thinking, but I would work to present the topic in a very open manner and encourage people to voice concerns, excitements and questions that we could then workshop through. This also presents an opportunity to start talking about the many resources while at Harvard. 
While hiking I would ask Peter to take the opportunity to encourage Philip to be more helpful and engage with others, which would hopefully also provide Mark an opportunity to take a place in the group that was based on more than an appreciation for his (overly) helpfulness. 
At some point before lunch I would want to do a partner hike. I would have Dan and Jack hike together, Suzy and Renee, Matilda and Philip, and Lizzie and Peter and Mark, and I would hike with Kelly. I am concerned that Kelly has an eating disorder or some other anxiety-driven issue that is making her generally uncomfortable and cripplingly aware of how she is being perceived by others. Forcing Dan to be separate from Philip will give him the opportunity to present himself in a more individual manner and Jack would have the potential to open up in a more intimate setting. Suzy seems like she would be a good ally for Renee, and a conversation between the two might be enough to remind each that they have value to add to the group. Renee needs to be reminded she has things to say even if she didn’t have an affluent upbringing and Suzy would benefit from realizing she has more to add to the group as a whole, independent of her interactions with Mark. In talking to Philip, Matilda may realize some things about maturity and Philip may get the recognition for his outdoor adventures and learn form those Matilda has had. Peter being grouped with Lizzie and Mark would provide the opportunity for a slightly more explicit conversation about group dynamics. Mark could be encouraged to make himself known for more than just helpfulness and Lizzie could build a connection with people other than Matilda that could then lead to her willingness to engage in conversations with others after having been forced to recognize the potential for bonds with other group members.
At lunch I would ask people to share something new they had learned about their partner in a respectful way. After hiking as a group for a while I would want to do a solo hike so people had time away from the group to think about how things were going and could come back to the group having processed individually before continuing to be in a group setting. Depending on how all this went, I would consider taking a more active role in assigning partners for evening tasks to continue mixing up pairings and also might have more individual conversations, especially with Jack and Renee.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[One of my strengths as a leader would be my interpersonal skills. I enjoy getting to know other people and would say that I am extremely personable. I would find a variety of different ways to relate to each of the first years I would be leading. This would help ensure that they have an enjoyable experience. As well, my past experience in mentorship positions would allow me to increase the value of their experience by encouraging the forging of deep relationships both between the foppers and I and the foppers themselves. 
In addition, my background playing soccer at a high level has instilled in a positive outlook on conquering physical challenges. Thus, one of my strengths would be the optimism I bring to the group as we all face the physical challenges of the trail. This optimism would be exponentially magnified by my love of hiking. Instilling a positive atmosphere in the group as well as encouraging friendship would be critical to the success of the trip and are two elements that I would be well-prepared to provide. 
Lastly, I relish the opportunity to be in leadership positions and have developed many valuable leadership skills through the experiences I’ve had in the past. This semester I further developed my outdoor leadership skills through the HOC leadership training program. I hope to bring this leadership experience, such as co-leading peers on an overnight trip, to benefit my foppers experience.

		<Q7.3><![CDATA[One challenge I would face would be teaching first-years technical camping skills if I am not confident in my abilities yet.  Unfortunately, my technical skills with regards to many necessary procedures such as bivouacking are not up to par. I also see how it could be a challenge to give each fopper the same amount of attention. It is easy to gravitate towards certain people and it would be a challenge to resist that urge. One of the greatest challenges I would face would be maintaining the group’s moral as a leader while completely exhausted. I remember how exhausted I was at the end of each day during Fop, and I know the leaders have many responsibilities outside of the foppers as well. It would be a challenge to fight being tired while energizing the group. 
Perhaps another challenge would be refraining from trying too hard to create an atmosphere of friendship. I have an incredible passion for mentorship and for engendering bonds between others and recognizing how they will  most likely be friends at the end of the trip, it would be difficult at the beginning not to –over foster those bonds. Additionally, it would be a great challenge to continue my leadership of these first year students throughout the year. Fop is not just a one week commitment it is an investment in each other’s lives. I would happily face the challenge to continue to foster my relationships with my foppers!

		<Q7.4>My decision to travel to Ghana alone this summer for an internship was an incredibly difficult decision to make. There were many elements of this decision that challenged my willpower, motivation, self-perception, and even my life goals. Going to Ghana challenged my willpower to explore and be an adventurer. There were points in the decision making process where I began to think I was crazy for wanting to spend 8 weeks isolated in an impoverished foreign country that I knew little about. I knew that part of the core of my being is my desire to explore and reach beyond the horizons I currently am exposed to. By forcing myself out of my comfort zone, I was destined to gain bountiful beneficial experiences, new lifelong friends, and an enforced confidence in my ability to adapt and accomplish my goals even in the most trying of circumstances. 
The question of whether or not to leap into this situation with so many unknowns in Ghana was a daily conflict. No one could answer the question for me. No one could provide advice that would ultimately make up my mind. The decision was solely up to me, and it was one of the most difficult decisions I had made in my life thus far. I could be happier to have made this leap of faith to travel to this unknown world, as this decision turned out to be one of the best I have made in my life.

		<Q7.5><![CDATA[There are a variety of different elements of this scenario that I find concerning. Perhaps my most pressing concern would be that Kelly is shivering during breaks. As a leader, it would not be appropriate to simply accept that Kelly is trying to tough it out and not put on another layer. Depending on the weather situation, Kelly could be in the beginning stages of hypothermia. Thus, I would find this potential medical issue extremely concerning. As I learned in WFA, one of the most important elements to overall wellbeing of the group is to ensure that each member is properly layered up. I would react by expressing my concern that it would not be good for her health to be in a state where her body is shivering. I would also make it clear that I am highly suggesting she put on another layer, to the point where she views the suggestion as something she should do.
The second major concern I would have would be Kelly and Jack’s participation in the group. Although the other foppers seem to have potential relational issues, Kelly and Jack seem to be rather uninvolved with the group. As a leader, I would see it as my responsibility to ensure that each member of the group was enjoying their experience. Perhaps Kelly and Jack are perfectly happy with the experience but are just rather introverted. On the other hand, maybe they feel excluded from the group or are having a tough time keeping up with the strenuous hiking. There would be many different considerations in analyzing the course of action to be taken. However, I would most likely just find a way to casually talk individually with each one and gauge the reason for their lack of active participation within the group. It would be extremely important to me that I did everything in my power to ensure that the foppers enjoyed their trip. Thus, Kelly and Jack’s apathy with regards to the others in the group would be concerning to me and something I would feel the need to address. 
My last concern would be the relationship between Peter, Philip, and Daniel. Although Philip is described as being self-absorbed and perhaps providing an attitude that is detrimental to the group and certainly Daniel, it is a personality issue that cannot be solved by a leader. That said, I would want to talk to Peter about his relationship with Philip. I would suggest that Peter put himself in situations where he is equally dividing his time between the foppers. Furthermore, I would mention to Peter that he should not show his frustration with Philip to other foppers. I would also be concerned that Daniel would be hurt by Philip’s attitude and would focus on uplifting his spirits and talking to him. The relationship between these three would be delicate but dealt with in the correct way would achieve a favorable balance in which each fopper could be happy.

		<Q6.1>August 2011: 7 day trip with my brothers in Alaska. Hiked and backpack in Denali National Park for 2 days, and spent the rest day hiking. I helped with navigation on the backpacking segment, and basically just enjoyed myself for the day hikes.

		<Q6.3>Going through FOP training last Spring gave me a peek into what the FOP community is like and how FOP goes about its business, which was a very valuable experience. I also started volunteering as a tutor with PBHA last Spring and while working with little kids is not directly relevant to leading a FOP trip, I feel like the process of reflecting on how the day went and what I can do to be a better tutor is good practice for reflecting on how things are going on a FOP trip and how I could go about being a better FOP leader. </Q6.3>

		<Q7.2>A potential strength of mine in leading a FOP trip would be a solid understanding of how a group works together, and an ability to determine what I need to do in order to connect with individuals and enhance their experience. Certainly my own experience of coming into an entirely new environment would help me relate to the experience that FOPpers are going through. I know how nervous I was going into FOP; walking into the yard on Aloha Day felt like a monumental experience and everything I did felt like it would either make or break my experience at Harvard. One of the great things I realized about FOP after coming back from our foray into the woods was that my perspective on Harvard had changed a lot. Yes, it still felt foreign and it still felt large, but it also made a lot more sense. I had gained some perspective on the place, which I totally attribute to the kindness and helpfulness of my FOP leaders and fellow FOPpers and something I hope to be able to replicate.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>I think a challenge of leading FOP for me would be keeping up the extroverted nature which seems to be the standard temperament of your average FOP leader. I tend to think of myself as a little bit more laid back, a guy who very much enjoyed the peace and quiet of our hikes on FOP. Something I really admired about my leaders was that they all managed to stay positive and upbeat through pretty much anything going on during our trip; they always seemed to have the energy to engage us in conversation or in a game. I think I could potentially struggle with a quieter group that was not generating their own enthusiasm organically, but it seems like one of the things that FOP leaders and FOP as a program excel at is generating enthusiasm. As a leader, I would hope to learn a lot from my fellow leaders in terms of knowing when and how to turn on this type of positive, infectious energy, and it would be a fantastic opportunity for growth for me.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I decided during the middle of my 10th grade year to stop playing basketball for my school. I felt a deep connection to basketball, especially at my high school; I remembered how much I loved watching my older brother play for our Varsity team. And things were looking promising that season. I would be playing JV again, but I had worked my way into a starting role and I was going to be one of the leaders on the team, with the possibility of being in on some Varsity practices later in the season. 
	However, I just wasn’t enjoying it. I didn’t look forward to practice or workouts, and I was pretty intimidated by the Varsity coach who ran the show. I thought I loved basketball, but for some reason I didn’t feel comfortable when playing. The week before the season began I decided to make a decision about what I wanted, instead of begrudgingly doing something that wasn’t enjoyable. My gut told me that quitting was the right thing to do, but I couldn’t help feeling that I was taking the easy road, overreacting to some hard lifting and sprinting sessions. I’m not accustomed to giving up on things, and I knew it would be strange not having basketball in my life. I can’t be positive it was the right decision because my perspective might have changed during the next three years. However, I made the right decision for me at that time, regardless of how difficult it was.

		<Q7.5><![CDATA[While the ideal FOP trip would focus primarily on creating strong bonds, as a FOP leader the primary concern should be the safety of one’s group. Hearing that Kelly is shivering during breaks is alarming. The amount of energy expended on FOP is enormous and it’s possible that someone who isn’t eating enough could be in danger. The difficulty of handling this situation is that I would want to maintain the utmost respect for Kelly while also making sure she is safe. If Kelly is working through some issues concerning eating it would destroy any trust I had built to call attention to this in a public manner, and it could get sticky to bring it up privately. I do think the shivering must be brought up privately since it needs to be addressed, and it doesn’t necessarily force Kelly to enter into a highly personal dialogue with a person she just met. My first responsibility would be to address the safety concerns, but to do so respectfully while recognizing their privacy.
My second concern is finding a proper balance of people sharing their stories about their lives while being mindful of other people’s positions in life. Lizzie and Matilda probably feel great about their conversations, but they left out Renee. It would be wrong to make major adjustments to prevent them from discussing their vacations, but there are little things to try. Maybe start Lizzie and Renee in conversation right before we get on the trail and get them to hit it off, while Peter tries to engage Matilda and Jack. Hopefully we could divert conversation away from foreign escapades and towards conversations about Harvard or sports or music, which provide more commonality. I noticed on my FOP trip that our leaders mixed our group up, diversifying who they interacted with, and organically altering up who we interacted with. This seems to be a better way of dealing with this type of situation instead of going to a more brute force method like forcing people to change spots in line each day or having a pointed conversation with the whole group about inclusiveness. A gentle nudge in the right direction should change things for the better.
My final concern is the Phillip-Daniel-Peter situation. It’s certainly a good thing that Phillip develops a connection with Peter, but it must be sincere and cannot come at the expense of Phillip’s relationships with his fellow FOPpers. No leader is going to be perfect, and it sounds like Peter might be justified in being a little bored with Phillip’s stories, but it is on us as FOP leaders to try and improve this situation rather than letting it be. This means that Peter needs to find a way to more sincerely engage with Phillip while hopefully including Daniel and allowing him to share himself. If that’s not tenable, then Peter should try to detach himself a little bit from Phillip and it can be my place to bring Phillip into the general fold of the group.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Throughout my life, I’ve been deemed the “mom” of my friend groups. Not only do I not know how to effectively use Twitter, but I also love taking care of people. Growing up as an only child in a financially insecure, single-parent household, I learned responsibility and independence sooner than many of my peers. I took care of myself, my younger cousins, and then, when I was twelve, I began babysitting other people’s children. As a FOPper this past year, I found it extremely valuable to have FOP leaders who I knew I could talk about anything with and who I felt genuinely cared for me. Because of my desire to nurture others and because I’ve experienced that many people feel very comfortable sharing their concerns, thoughts, with me, I think I could create an environment of trust and openness on my trip. 
Also, one of the biggest reasons why I am applying to be a FOP leader and something I would consider a strength in this application would be my passion for people and the outdoors. To me, developing meaningful relationships with another person is one of the most worthwhile things you can do in your life. As a FOPper, I had the opportunity to build lasting friendships with 13 other people. As a leader, not only would I be able to meet and connect with another group of students, but I would be facilitating the creation of friendships between my FOPpers as well…in the best place in the world—nature.

		<Q7.3><![CDATA[To be forward, I tend to be a bit of a control-freak. I like things to be organized and completed according to a well-thought out and agreed upon plan. From previous experience, I’ve found that it is difficult to do accomplish this in a group setting. It would be hard for me to be flexible, especially when I feel responsibility for the safety of my FOPpers and the success of the trip. Everything won’t go exactly according to our plan. Not everyone will respond excitedly to all the activities. Where nature and teenagers are involved, there will be surprises, and that thought stresses me out. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Since the fall of my junior year in high school I had been planning to climb Mt. Rainier or to travel to Europe the summer between graduation and coming to college. I had both planned out. The one catch was that I needed the money. By the time I needed to register for my climb of Mt. Rainier, I hadn’t been able to save up enough money by working, and it didn’t look like I would have enough by summer to go to Europe either. However, there was still the possibility I would get some graduation money. If I received enough I would go. No matter what. 
By the time graduation rolled around, I was desperate to leave. My wanderlust was unbearable.. After my graduation party, I summed up the gifts given to me by my wonderful family, friends, and community. I’m pretty sure I cried… I finally had enough. 
I gave myself a few days to think about the trip before buying the ticket to London. As I thought, I began to think about the potential costs of being a first-year college student at Harvard. I would need winter clothes, X-long twin sheets, club dues, textbooks! I couldn’t ask my mom to send money—we just couldn’t do that. All these expenses began adding up in my head, and before long, I couldn’t justify spending thousands of dollars on a summer trip when I just didn’t know what college would entail. While I still think I made the responsible decision, I am still overwhelmed by the desire to travel and climb mountains.

		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern is the cohesiveness of the group. Renee is feeling excluded by Matilda and Lizzie when they talk about their extravagant vacations and seemingly “well-off” upbringings. Phillip is actively trying to detach himself from being seen as one of the FOPpers by ignoring Daniel and spending most of the time talking to Peter. And Kelly and Jack are not interacting much with anyone else. I think it is extremely important for each FOPper to feel comfortable and united with the other members of the trip. To solve this problem, I would have a group sharing activity. On my FOP trip we circled around the camp fire and talked for 3-5 minutes each about our lives—our upbringings, challenges we had faced, fears, and dreams. It not only made us more aware of our similarities, but also our differences. I would hope that if Lizzie and Matilda heard Renee’s story, they might be more sensitive about how their stories might make her feel. Phillip, Kelly, and Jack might find that they have similar interests as the others in the group.  
My second concern is for Kelly. By the description in the story I am fearful that she may be feeling uncomfortable about her body and have a bad relationship with food (potential eating disorder). Having struggled with similar issues, I would casually share with her my experiences without making her feel obligated to tell me if she was experiencing the same problems. I would emphasize that she could talk to either me or Peter about anything that was troubling her. 
Speaking of Peter, my third concern is the lack of communication between Peter and me. I might just be nit-picking here, but I feel as if Peter and I don’t talk enough. I would want to talk to him about his interaction with Phillip. If any of the other FOPpers saw that he was dismissive towards one of them, I fear that they would not trust us and it would threaten our relationship with them. I also think that it is just essential to the success of the trip that Peter and I have a good, working relationship—that we make our decisions together and are both aware of the concerns in the group.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[The best FOP leaders I know, including my own, have become some of the most important people in the lives of their students by not only providing incredibly meaningful experiences during FOP but by serving as invaluable sources of support in Cambridge. I think my strengths lend themselves to both of these tenants. I have always been good at relating to people from a wide range of backgrounds with varying personalities. Leading a group of first-year students, I would be able to develop strong connections with every member of the trip—which will likely include a vast array of freshman. As a camp counselor, I worked primarily with a group of 12 academically gifted high school students, many of whom came from schools where they were considered “weird” and “nerdy.” The skills I learned through fostering relationships between these campers who were suddenly thrust into a completely new environment would help me as a FOP leader to communicate with and relate to freshman during the pivotal moment of entering college. As a PAF, I have experience helping support students during many of the pitfalls of freshman year (though I always valued the advice of my FOP leader over my PAF.) Finally, I think one of the most important strengths of mine in leading a FOP trip is the immense appreciation I have for my own experience. I absolutely loved every moment of FOP, and my time at Harvard would not be the same without it.  ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think the biggest challenge I would face as a FOP leader would be bringing the magic of a week in the wilderness back to campus. When I speak with my FOP leaders now, I can feel myself change. I have a different attitude, a sense of trust and a knowing of what truly matters that I lose amid the chaos of studying for a final or planning for Mission Hill. Hannah Borowsky’s article in The Crimson this fall characterized this feeling far better than I can possibly hope to do in 250 words (or even a million, for that matter,) but the message truly resonated with me. For me, FOP signified a critical part of my development into the person I am today, and I treasure the relationships I formed while hanging critter lines and snacking on gorp. Yet at Harvard, I think I lost focus of my priorities, abandoning in some ways the emphasis on personal development that dominated my experience in the wilderness. Each time I spoke with my FOP leaders, a little bit of that sense of wonder came back, but it was soon interrupted again by the pace of life here. As a FOP leader, I think the biggest challenge would be to instill in my students the desire and power to embrace the philosophy of the trail back on campus.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>Many of the difficult decisions I have made in the past year have revolved around my high school girlfriend whom I dated until this semester. Not only was the decision to end our relationship in itself difficult, but my intense emotional stake clouded the situation still further. My approach to solving problems is to talk to as many people as I can. I place enormous trust in the input and advice of people close to me, and I could not value their opinion more. Even more so, however, I think that people can often get entrenched in a single assumption or mindset. I personally tend to think in terms of benefits and costs, weighing the possible outcomes of a decision, which may not always be the appropriate approach. Factoring in the perspective of another can be a crucial resource in finding the best solution because it pushes you to expand your thinking and consider other angles. In the situation with my girlfriend, as with nearly every decision I make, I looked to those whom I trust most for input and advice. On FOP trips, I see this translating with my co-leader. Every pair of leaders I know seems to trust one another with anything, and that is exactly the type of relationship on which I thrive best.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern is that Renee is feeling left out and excluded by Lizzie and Matilda’s conversation. It seems to be difficult for Renee to relate to the stories that Lizzie and Matilda are discussing, and she seems to be less social as a result. This is a concern because forming relationships with your peers is perhaps the most important part of a FOPper’s experience. My goal would be to include Renee more in the conversation with Lizzie and Matilda and helping her to feel more comfortable socializing, while also allowing Lizzie and Matilda to continue to develop the bond that they seem to be developing. To do so, I would initiate a trail game among the group in order to include Renee in the conversation again just so that she had structured time to speak more than just one or two words. Afterwards, I would start a discussion that would help illustrate to Renee just how much she does have in common with Lizzie and Matilda, perhaps by asking the three of them what they are most concerned about in the transition to college.
My second concern is Daniel’s and Phillip’s relationship, particularly that Daniel seems to be struggling to connect with Phillip and engage him in his own stories. Instead of having meaningful conversations, Daniel seems to be resorting to crutches like “getting trashed” on campus – failing to form a true relationship. In order to remedy this situation, my aim would be to help Daniel talk about important aspects of his own experience and foster a bond with Phillip while also allowing Phillip to develop an appreciation of relationships with his peers. I would take advantage of Phillip’s interest in talking with me to include Daniel in on the conversation by responding to Phillip with questions for Daniel.
My third concern is Peter’s conduct with Phillip. When Phillip was recounting the story of trekking through the Alps, I think I may have spotted an eye roll from Peter, which is concerning on several levels. First, Peter may not be giving Phillip the right kind of attention to make his FOP experience as good as it can be if he has a negative attitude. Second, if Phillip also happened to catch the eye roll, he could be hurt and the relationship between the leader and FOPper could be severely hurt. Finally, if another FOPper saw Peter’s behavior, it could undermine the role of the leader as an objective source of support. Because the co-leader bond is so strong, I would feel comfortable approaching the subject with Peter at our discussion that evening after the students have gone to bed. I would start by asking how Peter thought Phillip was doing, and then say that both of us just needed to make sure that we were helping engage Phillip in a positive way.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[I am an Eagle Scout, and since 2006 I have been on close to 30 weekend camping trips (2 nights) with my Boy Scout troop. We have done backpacking trips, bike trips, canoe trips, winter tent camping & cabin camping. For about half of these trips, I have held an official leadership position (give direction and teach basic skills to 8-10 boys) or been a group cook. In the last few years, as one of the older scouts, I was a respected mentor and routinely led day hikes or other excursions. Additionally, I have been to a week long summer camp seven times (also with BSA) and participated in many outdoor activities there. The trips listed below do not include those standard boy scout weekend campouts. 
August 2013: Overnight campout in Wisconsin with 3 friends. Myself and a friend took two other friends camping for a night, so the two of us planned where to camp and planned our gear/cooking/food. 
Spring 2013: A few different day hikes with the Harvard Outing club (5-6 kids)
January 2013: 5 days of hiking, snowshoeing & cross-country skiing with Harvard Outing Club (30 students) I was an eager participant!   
June 2011: 6 days of whitewater rafting (not a continuous float trip though) with 8 boys & 2 adults (through boy scouts). One of the older kids on the trip – helped plan it. 
August 2010: Weekend campout in Wisconsin with Family – helped plan gear and meals. 
July 2010: 12 Day wilderness backpacking trip in New Mexico with 11 boys and a dad (boy scouts). I served as crew leader, so I represented the group at camp-wide meetings, led our hikes, directed our day-to-day schedule, led preparation hikes and trip planning and had the final say in crew decisions. 
July 2009: 3 night canoe trip. White River, Michigan. Enthusiastic participant.

2011-12: Senior Mentor. Paired with a freshman in hs to help him transition from middle school to high school and mentored him for the year – answering his questions and providing guidance for his adjustment to high school life. 
2012: Math tutor – tutored other high schoolers in algebra & geometry.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[1.	I keep an extremely optimistic perspective at all times, and I think that can help me in a leadership position. While there are days that things don’t go my way, there is no such thing as a truly ‘bad’ day- I don’t let those setbacks ruin my attitude. I think that a positive outlook sets a great example for the rest of the crew, and it can be extremely helpful in encouraging a team to not get disappointed by setbacks, and will help every team member learn from and enjoy the trip more. Keeping an upbeat attitude is a natural strength for me, even in less-than-ideal situations; I always try to make the most of my given situation. I’ve had experience in diffusing tensions between team members, and I’ve found that a positive attitude helps avoid and alleviate many tense situations. Also, I personally value creating a strong sense of community and good teamwork, so I would work to foster that in my crew. I’ve had success in teambuilding before, and I am good at helping crew members connect to each other, which is a crucial step in developing a strong team. Everyone benefits from having a closely-knit team, and I know that I am capable of developing that. Remaining optimistic and leading & creating a tightly-knit team are definitely my strengths.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[Though I am a friendly and accepting person, I could have difficulty connecting with certain crew member personalities. I know how critical it is to reach out to each person in my crew to try to make a connection with them or help them connect with others, and  I would try to do this by involving them in work activities, by looking for common links with other crew members, and by gently engaging directly with them.  I would want to get to know everyone in my crew, but if a particular FOPer seemed shy, slightly uncomfortable, or alternatively, overbearing or negative, I know it would be harder to connect with them, and make sure they are really learning from the experience and getting to know the other FOPers. I also recognize that despite my eagerness to increase their comfort level and sense of connection with the group, I must take care not to put them on the spot or make them even more uneasy.  With most people, I shouldn’t have this problem, but I know there are certain types of people that are harder for me to connect with.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One year, I chose between soccer clubs. One was the team I had been playing with for several years (Lakers), the other was one that a few of my former teammates had switched to because it was supposedly more competitive (Arsenal). First of all, the logistics (travel time and cost) favored the Lakers. Secondly, I considered the reason to leave the Lakers: many of the players were not as committed as I was, and our performance suffered. Arsenal played in a more competitive league and had more committed players, which was attractive: I would develop more as a player and have more fun. But I did not want to abandon my teammates, coach, and the club I had worked to develop.
 I struggled with the decision for a few days, then realized something that helped tip the balance. I realized I was as skilled as or more skilled than each of the 4 players who had previously left the Lakers for Arsenal. Considering that these former Lakers were now Arsenal players, I concluded that the Arsenal team could not be as good as it appeared to be. Because the competition and skill level were the only factors drawing me to Arsenal, I decided that it would likely not be worth the time and financial sacrifice to play for a team that was only as skilled as (or maybe marginally better than) the Lakers. I decided to captain the Lakers again the next year and I did not regret my decision.

		<Q7.5><![CDATA[I am most curious about Kelly's shivering - being cold makes you miserable, and, of course, even sick. Her shivering could just be a nervous habit, and she may not be that cold, but I definitely need to make sure that she is warm enough. It may not be a problem, but I must be sure. I would first playfully point out to her that she shivers all the time and that she must be freezing! It could help her become aware of her habit or her temperature. Then, as a general tip, I would remind our group that being cold is one of your worst enemies, so if anyone is ever too cold, they should speak up and the rest of the group won't be upset or anything because keeping warm is one of the most important ways to take care of yourself when hiking. Hopefully Kelly realizes that she actually is cold so that she can then focus on getting warm.

Renee's situation seems to be the most pressing social issue in the group - it seems that she has begun to feel disconnected from Matilda and Lizzie, and I can only imagine what kinds of doubts about college she may be having now - in particular she is likely feeling that she isn’t wealthy or worldly enough to relate to other Harvard kids. My solution would be to draw Renee into conversation with other FOPers who haven't been talking as much about their upbringing, or have had an upbringing less similar to Matilda and Lizzie, a childhood that Renee may be more comfortable relating too. The goal is to expose her to other types of people with other types of childhood, anything to allow Renee to see that all types of kids attend Harvard.

A third concern of mine would be that Phillip, in his belief that he is more mature than the other FOPers, is discounting his classmates and will not get to know any of them. Not only will he miss out, but the other FOPers may have a bitter experience with athletic gap-year New Yorkers. I would quietly suggest to Peter to first keep his distance from Phillip so that Phillip will talk to other kids, and second, reach out to Daniel so that Daniel does not become so dependent on Phillip. Then, while it may sound corny, my remedy would be to involve Phillip with other FOPers in some sort of game as we hike the next day, such as contact, ghost, an alphabet game…etc. They can spark conversation and can help him appreciate the great people on his FOP trip.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think one of my greatest strengths in leading a FOP trip is my ability to lead people efficiently and effectively.  I have had the opportunities in the past to test my leadership skills, and have had great success in the activities in which I have participated.  For example, the band in which I was the trumpet section leader my junior and senior years of high school won numerous national competitions, allowing me to test my leadership under pressure on a big scale.  But I have also dealt with the task of leading people in small groups as well, on sports teams and on projects.  Each one has come with their own unique set of challenges, and I think I have been able to lead each one with grace and competence.  
	Another strength of mine is my flexibility and ability to adapt to the unexpected.  On a FOP trip, it’s important to be able to adapt and resolve problems that may arise, and while it’s crucial to stay mission oriented on a trip, things happen that could impair the group’s ability to accomplish something.
	I think another strength of mine is my ability to be sympathetic to people’s emotions and needs.  I feel I am good at sensing what other people are feeling and how they are doing, which is important in any group dynamic, especially on a trip like FOP.  It’s critical that a leader help transition the freshmen, emotionally and physically, into their first year at college. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>One concern for me is working with a co-leader with whom I have never worked with previously, and leading freshman I am just meeting for the first time.  In my past experiences, I have always had leadership positions with and over people who I know and have interacted with in the past.  Part of the challenge will be meeting a FOP leader the week prior to FOP and building a working relationship so that we will be successful in providing freshman with the experience that they are looking forward to. 
	I also feel that it will be challenging to lead a group of freshman while also maintaining authenticity and allowing for the freshmen to connect with my co-leader and me.  Building relationships in FOP comes from connecting to people on a more personal level and allowing for your co-leader and FOPers to see your candid self.  Part of that comes from the nature of the trips: there is not much privacy in the backcountry; however, much is a result of talking and opening up during discussions and making each FOPer feel as welcome and comfortable as possible.  
	A last concern for me is simply leading freshman in the backcountry without knowing how each person will react to being outdoors.  Each FOPer has different needs and capabilities, and as a leader I would need to be able to adjust and cater to each FOPer and be responsive and reactive to how each one is feeling, including my co-leader.  </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>When graduating from my band last June, as the leaving trumpet section leader, per tradition, I was tasked with choosing the succeeding leader.  Below me were two rising seniors, Tom and Logan, and two rising juniors, Sam and Kyle, each of whom were in some way qualified to assume the leadership position.  What made my decision difficult was the fact that no matter who I chose, the section would have a great leader, and knowing that my decision had the potential to affect everyone else in the band.  I started listing down the tasks and roles I was required to face as a section leader myself, and then put those in the context of each of the four boys.  I had to ask myself, in each case, if they could properly handle the responsibilities associated with a leadership position, and I ultimately decided that Sam and Kyle, the rising juniors, were the two most capable.  Between the two, I had to factor in their skill level, so who would be able to lead most by example, but also personality and who might be the most sociable in resolving conflict.  I ultimately chose Sam, because although he is more reserved, he showed great leadership potential and was a more standout player than Kyle.  While I was worried that my choice might offend the players, I was pleased to see that all were satisfied with the new leader selection and I left the group with confidence that I had chosen wisely. </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[If I were a leader of the group described in the scenario, I would be worried about the exclusivity of certain subsets of the group.  Lizzie and Matilda, in light of their recent bonding, have invariably made Renee feel uncomfortable and isolated.  In addition, Philip’s lack of willingness to participate in the group negatively affects the group’s cohesiveness; Daniel attempts to engage Philip in conversation on multiple occasions, only to be ignored, which has the potential to hurt feelings.  Lastly, Suzy’s attention directed towards Mark could be seen as exclusive by other people on the trip.  My response would be to try to facilitate as much group interaction as possible in order to get more people involved and talking. This can be accomplished through activities in which FOPers are encouraged to be more involved, switching up the order in which we hike during the day, and trying as a leader to engage some of the more tacit FOPers in conversation throughout the day.  Even though it’s important that people on my trip bond with each other to help with their transition into college, doing so at the expense of group cohesiveness can cause problems.   
	 Another concern for me regarding this group is trying to get my FOPers to be more genuine and participate in the group dynamic.  For example, Kelly, while she has been doing nice things for others, seems to not be opening up as much about how she’s feeling as I think she could be.  I would be concerned that she is not being honest about how she is doing, and the fact that she seems to be cold frequently is a sign that she might not be feeling well.  In addition, it seems that Renee, once Lizzy and Matilda began talking about their upbringings, felt like she could no longer participate actively with the two other girls because she was self-conscious.  As a leader, I want my FOPers to feel comfortable and not apprehensive, so they are able to engage in the group as their most authentic selves. 
	A last concern of mine would be for the overall welfare of my FOP trip.  As I noted before, Kelly seemed to not be feeling as well as she could be, and potential illness is a cause for worry, as it could result in Kelly having to leave the trip early.  In addition, at camp, while I was taking care of setting up camp and getting dinner ready, I would be apprehensive about the potential danger that FOPers might run into at the caves if they decided to explore around the campsite.  Although I cannot micromanage everything the FOPers do, I would worry about their ability to exercise caution, especially those who have not had as much outdoor experience.

		<Q6.1>Summer 2013: I worked as a camp counselor in Raymond, Maine. The camp was set on a woodsy peninsula on Panther Pond. Daily kayaking, nature hikes, coaching, occasional outdoor-sleeping, and sailing.

August 2013: organized a camping trip for four friends in Southern California. Hiking, cooking on a campfire, tenting.

June 2013: four-day camping trip in Moab, UT with 6 friends. Multiple hikes each day. 

2008-2011: 5 four-day trips to Tijuana, Mexico to build homes. Outdoor-living; giant circus tents to live in; campfire breakfasts and dinners and sandwich lunches. 
</Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[In high school, I was a leader for our Tijuana camping trips. I was in charge of setting up the tents for people to sleep in, getting the meals ready, making sure that the tools for the site-work were taken along with us, and I was in charge of a subset of the 100+ person group. My group was 15 people. 

As a previous camp counselor, I have been responsible for others in nature. I have led high school students through the woods, on kayak trips, taught them how to clear trails, how to respect nature. Being a camp counselor has given me confidence in leading in the outdoors. I have always felt comfortable, myself, in nature, as I have been camping throughout my life, and I continue to get outdoors with friends when I can. But, now I feel very comfortable holding responsibility for others in nature. 

I have coached for years. In high school, I helped coach the junior varsity track team. I have also coached in a more formal setting at summer clinics (including one with Dick Fosbury!). I currently am a high jumper for the Crimson. Coaching has made me fall in love with teaching and leading, as it reminds me about how exciting it is to learn and gain new skills and experiences.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[
My biggest strength would have to be my passion. I have a passion for people. I get so excited when my athletes or interns start to identify with their hard work. I have loved being in a leader in different settings so much that I am on the path to become a teacher after graduation. This passion for other people’s development of skills was born when I headed Boeing Southern California High School Internship Program. It took a lot of preparation, communication, planning, organizing, and researching, but it was worth it! I enjoyed every step of the process. The 39 incoming seniors spent 8 weeks at Boeing for the summer, and I got to be the one to introduce them to their possible futures. The students were absolutely amazing. They are all so accomplished and motivated. The organization and communication skills that I refined through heading the internship program really allowed the program to run smoothly. I was so happy to find a passion for helping others find their passions! I think that passion will really play to my strengths in working with first-year students this summer. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>My greatest challenge would be connecting with all of the students. I have had a very positive experience at Harvard thus far, but I also understand that Harvard is a difficult place for many people. It presents many challenges that I may not relate with. I know that Harvard can be a very stressful place, and along with that can bring anxiety and mental health problems. Although this may seem like a challenge at first, I think that the opportunity to introduce the first-years to Harvard in a fun, natural, and bonding environment could help alleviate some of the stresses and anxieties that may be present in the pre-frosh stage. </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>A particularly difficult decision for me to make was that of choosing to attend Harvard. I was recruited for track by a few schools, but the decision ultimately came down to Duke and Harvard. After visiting Duke and meeting the track community, I was sold. I was ready to commit my four years of college to that school. I loved the coaches, the teammates, the campus, and the town of Durham. I became a Blue Devil almost immediately. After returning home and sharing the news that I would be so happy to be a Blue Devil, I decided to give Harvard a similar try. Again, the school was wonderful! I met the greatest personalities, some of the most clever and innovative minds, beautiful Boston, and the beautiful campus of Harvard. The choice was now impossible it seemed. To make the decision, I turned to my family and prayer. Prayer gave me peace about my choices and my family helped me see that Duke would be a place that I would find comfort, a place where my life would mirror my current life in many ways. Harvard, on the other hand, was one that would challenge me. It would provide me an experience unlike any I was currently familiar with. The choice of Harvard soon became the choice that would encourage me to grow. It would be one that would refine me. I was then, soon supported to take on the challenge of being a part of the Crimson community.  </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[One of my concerns would be that Renee was starting to feel less comfortable in the group. After being aware of her quietness, I would encourage group conversations. One thing that everyone could relate to and talk about together is the events that happened during the day. I would definitely talk with Renee and make her feel like her opinions are important. In addition, I would encourage the group to tackle tasks with each other, working with new people often. 
Another concern I would have is that of Kelly’s health. After noticing shivering, I would make sure that she has the proper layers on. I would offer her more clothes if that being cold is the reason why she is shivering. However, because she also is not eating all of her food on long days with lots of exercise, I would be cautious of her eating patterns. I would be a little worried about her eating health. I would take note of what she typically eats. I would encourage her to eat to stay energized for the days exercise. 
I think the concern of the next day’s plans would also be on my mind. I would consult my co-leader to put a plan together as to where/when we would start hiking the next morning. I would make sure that everything that night was set up for the next day, so that we could head out as planned. I would definitely be communicative and transparent with my co-leader. I think the best plans are made when people collaborate effectively. I definitely would plan to be supportive of my co-leader and encourage him in his leadership.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[This past year, I believe I’ve dramatically improved as a FOP candidate. My glaring weakness came through in last year’s interview––I sounded like a complete unemotional robot when asked to console a troubled FOPer. I had previously dealt with freshman in my high school, but never in so serious a state, and I was ill prepared. Over the summer, however, I did something new, something educational. I taught Taiwanese high school kids strategies for the SATs in Taipei as part of an 8-week program. The students ranged from 13-18 years old. Each day, I had two classes of 6-10 pupils and, after school, I would often continue teaching on a one to one basis. This was the closest I’ve ever come to truly being the mentor FOP wants in its leaders. These were the sweetest, smartest, more wonderful students anyone could ask for––yet they were also perpetually stressed about tests, high school, and applying to college. They tested my compassion and ability to comfort and encourage both on a group and individual level. It was a fantastic experience; this summer, I probably learned more than my students did. And I really could not have asked for a better lead-in to FOP. Looking back, I’m not so sure I was ready last time I applied. This time, I am.]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[When I consider my qualifications for leading a group of first-years, I find it necessary to begin by recognizing that I have yet to lose any of them in the woods. Granted, I’ve never done such a trip, but I also haven’t failed on such a trip. If, however, I am indeed awarded the opportunity to lead such a trip, I will channel my strengths like Popeye does his spinach into a delicious, nutritious, educational, safe, and wonderful experience. I’ve spent a great deal of time in the backcountry –– I can talk for hours or not at all. I’m an easy-going individual who isn’t hard on the eyes and, on occasion, can be comical, but, of course, I’m always nature loving, LNT-subscribing, and appropriately philosophical. I have delightful backcountry cooking skillz and can adapt to new methods of spelling depending on the organization for which I’m applying. I believe I’ve had a relatively simple and painless transition to and growth within college life, Harvard specifically, and I would easily be able to impart this upon the incoming first-years as well. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I can’t say I’m perfect for the job, however, as I do have some noticeable weaknesses. On average, I’m historically a relatively unemotional person, which makes it difficult for me to empathize with friends and family members when they’re in need. In these situations, I do my utmost to ensure that they know that someone cares, and deeply so, but oftentimes, I still feel like I’m not the best one to guarantee success. Nonetheless, I do feel that this complaint has decreased in recent months, due in no small part to teaching SATs in Taipei. I can also frequently become apathetic and complacent regarding particular situations. When my computer keyboard broke at home senior year, the ‘p,’ ‘0,’ and ‘/?’ keys ceased to function.  Rather than getting a new one, I just ran with it and whenever I needed one of those letters or symbols, I would Google it and then copy and paste it. Looking back, I think I probably could have been a bit more proactive about fixing my circumstances. Overall, however, I believe I’m working to overcome these challenges and can still be a marvelous FOP leader. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[The most difficult decision I’ve made up to this point in my life would have to be my college choice. I had been offered a fantastic scholarship at UVA and would receive no financial help at Harvard. By this point (April), I had already decided that the academics and opportunities were comparable enough to not make a noticeable impact on my decision. Thus, it came down to money and the people. Luckily for me, my parents are the coolest people on the planet and told me that I didn’t have to worry about finances; they would handle it and I should choose my college based on which one I liked the best. A week after I stayed at UVA for three days, I came up to Cambridge to live with a friend at Harvard for a weekend. I had a great time, and most importantly, met great people. I realized that I could conform to UVA’s preppy standard and enjoy it, but in the end, that wouldn’t be me; I would be wearing a mask. The people at Harvard are the ones I wanted to spend the next four years with, and so far, I definitely made the right choice.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[First off, I’m worried about Kelly. I often see her shivering during breaks, but she always says she’s fine and just needs to keep hiking. Now, I can’t yet confirm for certain that Kelly is sick, but the shivering, combined with her loss of appetite (she’s always giving away her cookies and dessert treats because she “gets full quickly”), is not a good sign. Before everyone can say how great their FOP trip was, they have to survive their FOP trip, and thus safety comes first. At the moment, my first aid isn’t completely up to par (I haven’t been certified in a year or so), so I can’t cure Kelly with confidence in this text box. But, I do know I would know wilderness training quite well by the time FOP starts. Thus, I think she is my #1 priority, even if I’m not really sure how to come to the rescue just yet. 

Beyond Kelly’s potential physically threatening illness, there’s a general issue of group cohesiveness. Renee no longer connects with Lizzie and Matilda while Daniel never has with Phillip. Kelly and Jack don’t seem to connect with anyone at all and Mark and Suzy may seem to connect a bit too well. By the third day of the trip, this is rather concerning. At night, I would definitely have time for everyone to give their autobiographies, and during the following days, I would have more game breaks with team bonding activities. Moreover, I would have individual conferences to talk to all the FOPers in a safe, secure, and more specialized setting. This way, Peter and I could talk to Kelly and Jack to see if anything’s wrong, and even if not, if there’s anything we could do to further their FOP experience without having them feel singled out. And most importantly, I would intentionally reorganize the hiking order to separate and mix certain individuals. There is a plethora of new possibilities, and I’d be sure to switch it up frequently. I want to get everyone as involved as possible.

My second concern was fairly broad and inclusive, so for number three, I’m back into potential physically threatening situations. Mark is great. He carries everyone else’s stuff for them. Very nice, yes, but very dangerous too. I don’t know Mark’s physical limitations, maybe even he doesn’t, and one day, he could severely hurt himself carrying all this extra weight. Hiking is tricky at best and especially so with a pack where balance becomes more an issue. The last thing I want to see is a FOPer injure him/herself on the trip, particularly in such an avoidable situation. Thus, that night, I would have a sit-down and explain the situation to Mark. Tomorrow, I would ensure that weight is distributed equally so we would all be safe, Mark free of future back pain at last.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[- Each winter since age 5: skiing/snowboarding trips with family in Lake Tahoe. I was an enthusiastic participant, always trying to stay on the slopes until the last lift closed!
- Various trips from age 5-12: hiking/camping/kayaking trips with Girl Scouts throughout California. I was a happy camper!
- Summer 2005: day hike and cave tubing with family in Belize. I was an excited kid!
- Summer 2008: 3 day backpacking trip with family in Huangshan, China. I was a passionate participant.
- Summer 2010: 3 day hiking/camping trip with family in Yosemite. I helped prepare food and navigate the trails.
- Various day hikes (2008-2013): day hikes with friends throughout Northern California. I helped plan routes and organized transportation.
- Summer 2012: 31 day backpacking trip with 2 friends through Europe. I helped plan the 10-country itinerary, searched for and purchased plane tickets, purchased Eurail pass and booked reservations for train tickets, booked hostels and apartments, ordered international student ID cards, reached out to and coordinated with friends living in Europe to ask for travel advice or to meet up, and set up international texting for emergency/communication purposes.
- August 2012: 3 day camping/boating trip with 5 friends at New Melones Lake. I helped purchase food, set up camp, cook food.
- August 2012: FOP 10 backpacking trip on the AT in Maine!!! I was an enthusiastic FOPper. Best week ever!
- January 2013: 5 day SCUBA certification training at the MAC. I was a happy participant.
- May 2013: 9.6-mile day hike with 1 friend in Mt. Tallac, Lake Tahoe. I prepared food and helped navigate the snow-covered trail.
- Summer 2013: 6 week biodiversity program with 1 professor and 7 Harvard students in the Dominican Republic, involving snorkeling, hiking, boating, and catching insects/fish/other little critters. I was an excited student!

In addition to my current outdoor experience, I am very excited to continue to learn outdoor skills and gain more familiarity with the outdoors. I was fortunate enough to have been exposed to the beauty of nature throughout my childhood, but as I’ve grown up my desire to spend time exploring the outdoors has grown beyond the extent to which my family participates in outdoor activities. Because of this, in recent years I have taken more initiative to plan independent trips, and would be thrilled to learn more skills and spend more time in the outdoors!]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[- High school water polo team (2008-2011): As goalie, I acted as the eyes of the team, telling teammates how much time was left on the shot clock, what plays to run, players to watch out for, who was open to pass to, when to come back on defense, etc. As captain, I led warm-ups and kept the team motivated in tough times.
- FIRST Robotics (2008-2012): As Mechanical Design Director, I taught workshops on SolidWorks (computer-aided design software) and design principles, was responsible for mechanical design of the robot, divided up mechanical team into subteams and oversaw the subteams, communicated and coordinated with fabrication director to make schedule and ensure that all parts were ordered/manufactured correctly. As a Technical Award Presenter, I created design manuals and presentations detailing the strategies, design decisions, and fabrication processes of our robot, and presented to judges. As co-pit captain, I was responsible for working with my co-captain to delegate tasks and lead the pit team to fix robot malfunctions during high stress situations at competition. As safety captain, I was responsible for making sure everyone knew and followed all the safety procedures in the lab and at competitions.
- Lego robotics mentor (2009-2011): As a mentor for a middle school Lego robotics team, I taught students the basics of game strategy, Lego robot design, assembly, and programming, and also answered any questions they had.
- Speech & debate (2009-2012): As extemporaneous speech captain, I ran weekly practices, which included assigning research topics, leading speech exercises, and giving feedback on practice speeches.
- Service trip to Oaxaca, Mexico (2010-2011): My teacher and I organized a trip to take 14 students to volunteer at an orphanage and help plant organic gardens. I helped organize fundraisers and clothing drives, contacted rotary clubs for donations, and was responsible for organizing much of the logistical information during the planning process. After the trip, I gave a presentation about the trip to a rotary club, and I wrote and published an article about the trip in Palo Alto’s sister city newsletter.
- Algebra Teaching Assistant (2011-2012): I worked in a hands-on fashion with high school students, many of whom had previously flunked out of algebra and were taking the class for the second time. Working with these students was often a big challenge, because for many of them school was not a top priority and math was definitely not their favorite subject. One day, I had the pleasure of teaching a lecture myself, while the teacher sat in the back of the classroom. Afterwards, he said that he was amazed that the students paid more attention to me than they ever did to him!
- Yard Athletic Council (YAC) (2012-2013): As the IM rep for my dorm, I sent out emails to my dorm, found captains and coordinated with them, motivated people to play IMs, worked with the rest of YAC to select and organize IM sports seasons and tournaments, and also captained several sports. It was a challenging yet rewarding position that pushed me out of my comfort zone because I had to approach people I didn’t know to ask them to play.
- The Radcliffe Pitches (2012-2014): As business manager, I am in charge of organizing logistics with clients, communicating with the music director and stage manager to create a set list and uniform, communicating all gig info to the group and making sure everyone is on time. I am also responsible for creating the annual budget and keeping track of finances. I also organize concert ticket sales, motivating the group to sell tickets through a new incentive system. Finally, I try to make sure to limit as much as possible any costs that individual members have to pay, and also make sure everyone is comfortable letting me know if they have concerns with the individual contributions so we can work out a solution privately.
- Lev HoCo (2013): As IM rep assistant, I am in charge of the IM tournaments, which means sending out emails and publicizing tournaments, and coordinating with the IM co-chairs. As a HoCo member, I help organize house events and publicize throughout the house.]]></Q6.2>
		<Q6.3><![CDATA[On the first day of FOP, I was a timid pre-frosh aching to go home and wondering why in the world I was put on supposedly one of FOP’s most difficult routes. I was excited for school in a superficial way, but looking back I can say I was definitely not fully prepared to start college. Through FOP, I began to learn to throw away the self-doubt I had – starting with the bandana on which we wrote all of the things we would leave out of the trip, and constantly the trip by seeing my leaders and fellow FOPpers work so hard with smiles on their faces. It helped me realize that I am strong, and I can succeed with the support of a loving group of people. Inspired by the strength and courage of my leaders, and by the resilience and energy of the other members of my FOP trip – I was motivated to keep on going, even up the steepest, rockiest climbs. I was challenged both physically and mentally, in a way that helped me begin to understand the spirit and kindness of my future classmates, and allowed me to better appreciate the experiences and friendships of college to come. I really felt welcomed to Harvard, and to this day my FOP group remains one of my closest and most loving communities on campus, which I value deeply.

In the way that my leaders acted as mentors and friends to me, I want to be that for incoming first-years – a helping hand to show them their own strength and to guide them into one of the most daunting yet exciting times in their lives. Were I to have the opportunity to lead FOP, I would be dedicated to fostering and maintaining a sense of community both on the trip and after (FOP reunions throughout the year!). Particularly as someone who was not fully prepared to come to college, the past year and a half has taught me a lot about myself and about college, in a way that I feel would allow me to help those students who are going through such a difficult transition. Besides having experienced the transition that goes on during the first semester of college, I have also experienced the two semester that follow – though less drastic of a change, each semester of college usually only gets harder and harder. I have realized the importance of friends and community that help you get through tough times. Because of this, I feel that I am now better aware of the challenges that first-years face throughout their first year, and would be able to act as a better support system for them.

Through my involvement as an IM rep for Holworthy, now as the business manager of the Pitches, and now as a member of Leverett HoCo, I have expanded the breadth of my experiences and have pushed myself outside my comfort zone. The leadership skills and experiences I have gained through these positions make me more confident in my ability to lead a group of first-years. As business manager of the Pitches, I have dealt with sensitive subjects such as finances, made difficult decisions on whether or not to do certain performances, and improved my organizational skills. As a member of HoCo and an IM rep, I have pushed myself to be more confident and outgoing.

The past year and a half has seen many highs and lows, and there have been many times in which I have been filled with self-doubt. I have been tested and pushed to my limits, which has helped me identify my weaknesses and see who I would like to become. For this reason, I want to lead FOP because I want to continue to grow as a person, and I think leading FOP would help me to grow in a new way than participating in FOP has. Given the chance to train to be a FOP leader, I would take every opportunity to participate in experiences that would help me grow and improve myself, and I would whole-heartedly be a member of the FOP Leader community.

In the past year, I have also spent more time exploring the outdoors – through a hike of Mt. Tallac, a 6-week biodiversity summer program in the Dominican Republic, and several day hikes throughout Northern California. I am also very excited to be going on the Outing Club’s wintersession trip in January 2014!]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I believe that I maintain a good balance between being a leader and being a team player. As a leader, I connect well with the group by making myself accessible, not intimidating. I would characterize my style of leading as relaxed while still being effective and attentive to details. I am even-tempered and stay calm under pressure, being sure to think things through and do things one step at a time. I think these characteristics would prove helpful in a FOP setting because I would be able to connect well and lead FOPpers, and I would be equipped to deal with stressful situations.

I really make an effort to be there for others as a friend/mentor. As my high school water polo coach told us when a teammate suffered from a deep loss, it is important for us to be a system of “drop everything” friends – those who will drop whatever they’re doing to help a friend in need. Even when I’m busy studying for an exam, I try to take time to do kind things like bring chocolate to a friend who has an exam that night. When high schoolers in the grade below me were starting freshman year at Harvard and would ask me questions, I always took time to write thought-out responses to them, hoping to share as much of what I’ve learned in the past year as possible with them. I think this attitude would carry through with my FOPpers in helping them through their transition.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think a challenge in leading a group of first-years would be that I am afraid to make decisions alone. Growing up as the youngest child and as one of the youngest people in my grade, I have always felt comfortable asking questions and asking for help. However, this has also caused me to feel less comfortable when I am unable to seek a second opinion or consultation, and have to make decisions completely on my own. I have been working to improve my self-confidence and independence by going outside my comfort zone with roles such as IM rep and Pitches business manager, where I often have to make final decisions with little to no outside help.

Another challenge is that I am not very good at staying in touch with people. Though I am always really open and willing to meet up with or help people out when they ask, I am not often one to initiate contact. I have been working on being the one who actively reaches out, and more recently have been contacting old friends and classmates who I haven’t seen in a while – an experience that has been very rewarding, and makes me realize how important it is to keep kindling these friendships.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[A month ago, my a cappella group received a request to sing the national anthem at a Harvard-Yale hockey game at Madison Square Garden in New York during winter break. Initially, I was excited because the performance would be an incredible opportunity for our group to get exposed to a huge audience (and different from our normal clientele) and sing at a world-famous venue. However, I had several concerns: First, in terms of financial feasibility, the client was willing to cover our performance fee and free game tickets, but was not willing to cover any costs of transportation or accommodations. Secondly, when I brought up this gig with the other officers, it was clear that people had very different opinions – some people were very enthusiastic, while others were extremely against taking extra time away from being at home with family, especially since we already have a 5-day winter tour. This also brought up the issue of making sure people didn’t feel forced to go and pay for their own transportation and accommodations. Thirdly, we are first and foremost a musical ensemble, and it was concerning that we might not have enough people to look like a presentable group and uphold the musical quality that we value. In the end, after receiving feedback from the other officers, I decided not to accept the gig request because we would either have to pay for everyone to go, or ask people to pay themselves, neither of which would be feasible for our group.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first priority is making sure all my FOPpers are safe and healthy. I am concerned that Kelly is often seen shivering during breaks, because even a short break can get very chilly, especially on peaks when there is a lot of wind. I am also concerned that Mark is carrying a huge amount of the group gear and other FOPpers’ personal gear. I see this as an issue because we need to ensure that he does not get severely injured because of his super heavy pack, and also because FOP is a team effort and all FOPpers should be helping to carry group gear. I would deal with these issues of health and safety by initiating a group conversation reminding people that everyone must keep a layer in the brain/top of pack and put it on when we stop for packs off breaks, and reminding everyone that carrying group gear is a team effort and encouraging everyone to take a fair share. Each time we take a longer break, I would remind people to put on extra layers to protect from the cold. Each morning when we pack up camp, I would encourage each person to take 2-3 items of group gear.

My next concern is that Renee feels isolated from Lizzie and Matilda, especially when they talk about their upbringings and family vacations. This is concerning to me because I want to make sure no one feels uncomfortable or left out based on their background. I also want to make sure everyone is aware that not everyone has the same upbringings, and that it is important to be sensitive to this when discussing backgrounds. To deal with this, I would have a group conversation about life at Harvard, during which I would talk about how freshman entryways are a family, and how they try to put a diverse and vibrant group of students in each entryway. I would stress that you will meet people who come from all different backgrounds, with all sorts of different interests, and one incredible part of being at Harvard is getting to know people from all walks of life!

My last concern is with Daniel asking Phillip to “get wasted” on campus. I want to ensure that no one feels uncomfortable or pressured to drink in college, and also that everyone is safe no matter what social activities they choose to partake in. In response, I would turn this into an opportunity to have a group conversation about social life at Harvard, stressing the many different options, many of which do not involve alcohol. I would talk about the different ways that people can insure to stay safe, such as the amnesty policy at UHS and keeping track of number of drinks. I would also do the “fear in a hat” activity, so that my FOPpers can ask questions about social life, or general concerns they have for entering college. This could also be helpful in addressing the second concern about upbringings.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[August 2013—Attended FOP; I really enjoyed my experience on FOP. I feel like I learned a lot about the outdoors through the skills I acquired there. From learning how to put up a tarp shelter to cooking outdoors, it was an incredible experience that I hope I can provide for others as a FOP leader. Additionally, I learned a lot about wilderness conservation due to the fact that I was on a Switch-Service FOP trip. On the trip we met with a representative from the Green Mountain Club who talked to us about the work that the club does and how we could possibly be involved with it in the future. 

June-August 2013—worked as a camp counselor at an outdoor day camp for young children. Specifically, I really enjoyed taking the kids on trips to the lake and teaching them about water safety. 

June-August 2012—attended a leadership program geared towards preparing me to work as a camp counselor at a wilderness overnight stay camp. I gained invaluable experience with outdoor skills such as canoeing, outdoor cooking, and overnight wilderness camping. I later interned at this same camp and worked with kids to teach them the same skills that I was lucky enough to learn.

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[
September 2013-present—I volunteer as a mentor with Strong Women, Strong Girls (a program through PBHA), in which I take weekly trips into South Boston to mentor young girls in the valuable skills they’ll need to grow up strong and proud in the modern world. Specifically, this involves teaching them about strong women throughout history who have used their own unique skill sets to achieve their dreams and ultimately, strive to make the world a better place. 

September 2012-May 2013—I worked as a tutor (both volunteer and paid) for kids struggling in various subject areas at my high school. It was a really awesome experience that really cemented in my mind the value of teaching and mentorship to encourage success.

***My other teaching experiences were explained above as my involvement over the last two summers with work at summer camps where I was able to teach kids about the outdoors and how to both enjoy themselves and benefit their surroundings through various recreation and conservation efforts.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think that my primary contribution to a  FOP trip would be my communication skills. My favorite part of my own FOP trip was how well I got to know my fellow FOPpers and the authentic connection that I felt we made. In college, and particularly at a school like Harvard, it’s so easy freshman year to feel like you’ve met a ton of people but really don’t know any of them. If not for the tremendous friends I made through FOP, I personally would have been completely lost this year. Being away from one’s family for the first time, it’s so easy to shut down and close one’s self off from others, especially when confronted with personal problems that seem world shattering in the moment. I hope that I would bring to a FOP trip the sense of community that I felt with my own FOPmates. As a FOP leader I would actively seek to make sure that every one of my FOPpers felt like they mattered, that someone understood them and cared about their struggles. This is incredibly important to me because I am reminded every day of the value of support, and every day I think of FOP as the experience that gave it to me. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think that my primary struggle as a FOP leader would be figuring out how to lead a group of students so close to my own age. I have a lot of teaching experience but it largely comes from working with kids a good bit younger than myself. I think that there’s an important distinction that must be made up front: these are college students. While it may be their first year, they still have a much greater sense of their own independence than does the average middle schooler. I think that my main focus throughout FOP training would be in learning how to modify my teaching and leadership approach to accommodate a group of people who come from a much more mature viewpoint than what I’m used to. However, I think the key is to approach situations from the viewpoint of a mentor, not as a parent. I think that recognizing the skills and ideas that FOPpers will each bring to a trip goes a long way to communicating the idea that you value their opinion and are trying to help them, not lecture them. Each of them is brilliant and unique in their own way. I think that the role of a great FOP leader is to use those skills to encourage further growth and ultimately, create a great experience for everyone. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Probably the biggest decision that I can think of was my decision to come to Harvard. While perhaps a cliché answer, the decision was, for me, ultimately life changing and by no means an easy one. Specifically, it came down to a discrepancy between what logically was probably the best answer and what, in the moment, just felt right. At the time, I was pretty sure that I was going to be pre-med. So from the strictly logical standpoint, enrolling in the Brown PLME program, in which I would automatically get a slot in their medical school was by far the clearest answer. Why go through the awful stress of the pre-med lifestyle when an easier and clearly safer (statistically speaking) option was available? For me, it came down to what some might call a “gut feeling” but what by now I choose to think of as an “informed inclination.” Why, I had to ask myself, was I going to college? Was it simply to get to a final destination or to change my worldview? Was I looking for training or an education? Ultimately, I chose the harder route. I chose Harvard, not for prestige or a sense of external obligation, but because I honestly felt that this place could turn me into the person that I wanted to be. Now, this is by no means intended to be negative towards Brown. I loved Brown and I still do. In fact, one of the factors that I wish I had considered was the culture and environment, which in many ways should have sent me running in the opposite direction from Harvard. All I’m saying is that my decision was based on a mix of logic and feeling. Harvard makes sense, but it also feels right. I’m sure in the future, I won’t have the luxury of this dual compatibility but for now, I’m certainly happy with how things turned out.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[In this situation, my immediate concern is one of safety. Kelly, is clearly exhibiting unsafe behaviors and this is incredibly concerning. The fact that she is giving her food away on FOP, an experience that invariably results in a massive appetite, is very concerning. Additionally, the fact that she is shivering indicates that her body is not generating enough heat, a possible result of under-consumption of food. My first step would be to talk to her about the situation. I would encourage her to eat by reminding her of the physical exertions ahead. If she still refuses to eat then I would say that the next step would be to slow the pace. As she is exhibiting signs of malnutrition, it would ultimately be unsafe to continue exercising at a rigorous pace. I would continue talking to her about the problem but, I think it’s important to realize that if these actions persist, they may very well be the result of anorexia or some similar condition. In this case one should realize that this can’t be cured by simply talking about it. This is a psychological condition that needs professional assistance. All that can be done on a FOP trip is to ensure the immediate safety of all the participants until arrival back on campus. 

Second, I would worry about the situation between Lizzie, Matilda, and Renee. While I don’t think that Lizzie and Matilda are being malicious in their exclusion of Renee, the first step would be to make them aware of the situation. In a very mild-mannered way, they should be encouraged to think of topics for discussion that others can participate in as well. This is important because FOP is an important opportunity for group connection and the development of deep relationships. This can only be accomplished in an environment of openness and inclusion. If Renee is made to feel like an outsider from the group that this feeling will surely persist beyond FOP, a situation that runs directly counter to what FOP is designed to achieve. 

Third, I think it’s important that the situation between Philip and Peter be resolved. I know from my own FOP experience how much FOPpers look up to their leaders and how upset Philip would be if he thought Peter found him annoying. Therefore, I would first talk to my co-leader. In a very diplomatic and non-confrontational way I would emphasize that while some FOPpers may be abrasive or annoying, they usually have a tremendous amount of respect for their FOP leaders. Therefore, it’s important that they always feel like their leaders value them and what they have to say. Additionally, I would speak to Philip about maybe trying to find areas of commonality with his fellow FOPpers. While leaders can be an excellent resource, I feel that it’s ultimately one’s fellow FOPpers that become one’s true source of support. It would truly be a shame if Philip was unable to take advantage of these relationships.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[I truly love spending time outside; there’s something about the outdoors that really lends itself to getting to know a very true side of someone, as well as yourself. Some of my best memories from growing up are of camping in the backyard and scrambling on rocks with my siblings. Prior to FOP, I had done day-hikes with a light pack and the only “skill” I had practiced was looking for trail markings. So while I don’t have extensive technical outdoors skills, I do feel extremely comfortable and happy being outside. I would be excited to learn advanced skills to enable this amazing FOP experience for incoming freshmen. I felt physically safe every moment on Pat and Danielle’s trip and could see what a difference it made to have leaders who were well prepared. It’s hard to describe how exuberant and in the moment I felt while being on FOP, soaking in the beautiful conversations and never knowing what time it was. Many self-discoveries happened during FOP that I think could have only occurred while being outside in essentially “new territory.” ]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[1. From September ’12-January ’13, I interned in the Education Department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I worked for the woman in charge of the Teen Programs and helped her plan upcoming weekend programs, assisted during them, and strategized with her on what we could improve for the following event. During events, my main role was to create a welcoming, comfortable environment. It can feel risky to share opinions about art, especially around strangers, so much of what I aimed to do was connect participants with each other, enabling them to speak up with more certainty and take a larger risk during the studio projects. 

2. I worked as a lifeguard and, eventually, swim instructor, the summers after my junior and senior years of high school. I was given minimal teaching instructions and primarily learned by doing, observing what was most successful with the other instructors. Again, I saw that the best role I could play was to not only make them feel comfortable and safe about being in the water, but to make the experience fun. 

3. Since eighth grade I’ve been babysitting – I like that it requires balancing parents’ guidelines and using split-second judgment. I’ve enjoyed learning how to be a fun and friendly leader while maintaining confidence to make unpopular decisions when necessary (because of safety, time, parental instructions…). I’ve loved having continuity with the kids I look after, and babysitting is the perfect example of how you can learn so much from those younger than yourself!

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I feel I am able to truly connect with all kinds of people and form special and honest relationships with them. I love learning about people and being excited with them about something wonderful in their lives, as well as listening to what they’re anxious and uncertain about. I would work to set an extremely positive tone for their freshmen year. Harvard is the best school imaginable, and I’d be eager to share my enthusiasm with them. 
I also consider myself someone who values taking risks, while using judgment to see both the details and big picture of a situation simultaneously. I’m comfortable asking questions when information isn’t clear to me, and am not embarrassed to admit that I don’t know something. I feel I would be able to recognize what taking a risk would mean to each of my FOPpers. 
While there will be difficult moments on the trip and at Harvard, I am of the strong belief that very rarely does a genuine source of support fail in solving those problems or relieving tensions. I’m certain everyone at FOP hopes freshmen find this in their friends, proctors, and other people they meet, but it would be a huge priority of mine to make sure FOPpers found this in me, as well. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I acknowledge I’m on the quieter side. However, I definitely don’t consider myself shy. I work to form meaningful relationships with people who communicate in all kinds of ways. I think I could have a particularly positive influence on the quieter members of the group, who may need more individualized support in order to find their place within the group. Through my actions and anecdotes from my life at Harvard, I could show them that being quiet doesn’t mean being overlooked or being unsocial. 
I also admit to being somewhat of a perfectionist – I might consider it perhaps too much my job to make sure people were enjoying themselves. While FOP leaders definitely have a responsibility to do all they can to lead a positive and upbeat trip, they also must accept that some things are out of their control and they can’t blame themselves. In no way do I mean to suggest a “whatever” or “oh well” attitude, but sometimes things must be put into perspective in regards to the larger arc of the trip. 
I’d say the most obvious challenge I faced on my FOP trip was the hiking itself. I really should have been more prepared physically for the trip. I didn’t dance practically at all during my gap year. I have been able to get back into a more regular dance schedule this semester and have tried to increase my physical stamina in other ways as well. 
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I wanted the challenge of going abroad to Italy during my gap year. I craved an authentic experience, so I was insistent to avoid programs designed for English speakers. Through an acquaintance, I found an Italian family I could stay with for four months and a local high school willing to accept me.
I knew this would be risky, as my Italian was nowhere near perfect, and I had no background in philosophy, the Italian legal system, and other courses fifth-year students studied; but I thought it would be an incredible opportunity to be immersed in daily Italian life and meet people my own age. I predicted I’d likely have to adjust my plan once there, which was extremely accurate! Most Italian students go to school six days a week, don’t change classes during the day, and return home for lunch, so I only met a
few students. And because of the upcoming “maturità” exams, the stress level amongst the students was astronomical. While I’m glad I got a taste of the school, it definitely was not the best way to spend my entire stay. I made the difficult decision to leave the school knowing I would disappoint the principal and my host family. I did my best to make it clear that I was really grateful for the opportunity.
Looking back, it worked to my favor that I didn’t know all the details of my trip, because it allowed and required me to be so spontaneous, decisive, and flexible. 
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Before attending to the multiple issues within the group, I would be conscious of the dwindling daylight and finish setting-up camp. And while there are many nuanced social circumstances that would require attention, safety must be acknowledged before social. After quickly checking in with Peter and agreeing to check in more thoroughly later, my first priority would be to make sure Kelly isn’t sick. I’d make it clear that in no way should she feel embarrassed if she were in fact ill and that it is not a burden to the group. She could be shivering from hypothermia, fever, or in the event that her pack/clothes got soaked, and I’d need to know. And her infrequent eating could potentially be an eating disorder. 
Second, I would check in more extensively with Peter. I’d want to look at our route for the following day to make sure we are very clear. Adding mileage can be risky both for exhaustion and the shorter daylight upon arriving into camp, not to mention, getting lost twice in a row would likely make FOPpers feel uneasy. Many of the issues described in the scenario center on inclusiveness; I would tell Peter the concerns I noticed and ask if he had any others. Once we communicated clearly about what needed particular attention, we would strategize our approach. We’d brainstorm pairings for camp tasks and a new hiking order to mix up FOPpers. Ideally, we would have gathered basic information on the FOPpers and could decide what order (alphabetically by first/last name, birthday) would position certain people away from/next to each other. If he didn’t bring it up, I’d ask how he’s feeling about Philip, and brainstorm what he could say to him. 
My third action would be to informally check in as a group during dinner. It’s usually unhelpful to pointedly acknowledge/suggest that we make a better effort to engage with all members of the group. I’d probably say: “It’s half-way through the trip, and usually around this time, I like to ask my groups to check in with themselves about how they feel about their group contributions and how they’re connecting with everyone. Think how awesome it would be if at the end of the trip we all felt like we knew every other person super well.” It’s easy when you meet someone who is similar to you (Lizzy and Matilda) to latch onto them. Often, people aren’t aware if they’re being exclusive, and it takes a reminder. Also, people often feel there’s a point at which it’s too late to join in with the group or get to know someone. Hopefully this reminder, along with a game of boom boom chang, would casually reverse this.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[Since I applied to be a FOP leader two years ago, I’ve continued to go on day hikes locally, as well as a few short backpacking trips in Peru two summers ago. More importantly though, I’ve gained a lot of leadership experience. Through my varied experiences in some of Harvard’s arts communities, I’ve learned how to effectively lead people while maintaining a pleasant environment even in extremely difficult circumstances (like building a massive set in a short period of time with only a few inexperienced people to help). Although it first glance it may seem like producing a show and leading a FOP trip have little in common, I think my extracurricular experiences have given me the skills I need to be a great FOP leader. My experience living in Peru for a summer was also good preparation for leading a FOP trip. I lived with a Peruvian family in Lima and had an internship in a different part of the city, so I had to learn to navigate the city by myself and fit in to the work environment, in a very different culture where few people speak my first language. My experience gave me a lot of “street smarts” and made me much more independent and confident. When I applied to FOP two years ago, the idea of leading a group of freshmen on an extended trip in the wilderness was intimidating; now, I feel well-prepared for the challenge. Finally, as a junior, I’ve experienced a lot of aspects of life at Harvard, and I think I could be a good source of advice and experience to incoming freshmen as well as a good trip leader.]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[My aforementioned leadership experiences have allowed me to develop a lot of skills that would make me a great FOP leader. Although a theater is a very different setting from the woods, being a producer similarly involves making important decisions in real time while remaining calm and confident and maintaining a positive atmosphere. I’m comfortable with making quick decisions, putting the good of the group above my own, effectively communicating what needs to be done, keeping the group positive and motivated, teaching difficult skills patiently, and taking responsibility when things go wrong, and I am always willing to take on as much work as possible in order to help the group succeed. FOP was a really meaningful experience for me: it helped me become much more comfortable being myself, which has made me a lot happier in college. I want to make sure that all of next year’s FOPpers have just as positive a transition into their freshman year, so if I am a leader I will work hard to make everyone feel like a valuable part of the group and a valued person.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think that my interpersonal and leadership skills would make me a good FOP leader, but I need to work on some of my technical skills. I have a terrible sense of direction: I sometimes get lost while trying to find my way around Boston, never mind the Appalachians. I’m not very physically strong, which might not seem like the most important attribute for camping—until it’s time to set up the tents and you can’t hold enough tension in the rope to keep the tarp from falling on your face. I also really struggle with tying knots (it took me hours of practice to learn how to tie a necktie). As far as personality flaws go, I have a tendency to take on most of the work myself rather than rely on others, so I would have to remind myself to trust my co-leader and have faith in my FOPpers as well. Finally, I sometimes hold myself to unrealistically high standards, so I might blame myself and be pretty upset if any of my FOPpers didn’t have a good time, even if there was nothing I could have done; I would have to learn to accept that some people might not enjoy FOP despite my doing everything I could to the contrary—and ensure that my own mood not be affected, as that could have a negative impact on the rest of the group.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[The most difficult decision I’ve had to make in college was stepping down as music director of my a cappella group (which was a subset of a choir) after one semester. Going into my sophomore spring, I was planning on quitting the choir, which would mean I couldn’t sing in the a cappella group either; I had been extremely overcommitted in previous semesters, and wanted to focus on theatre, which is my biggest passion and my professional goal. However, there was no one interested in being music director of the a cappella group, and as I had a lot of experience with music directing, I volunteered. But it quickly became clear that I had bitten off more than I could chew; I was barely sleeping or doing homework, and I still didn’t have adequate time to prepare for rehearsals. At the end of the semester, I decided to stop singing in the choir and the a cappella group. This was difficult because the music director generally serves for two semesters, and I felt like I was letting the group down. My responsibility and faithfulness to my commitments is one of my traits that is most important to me, so I was disappointed in myself for not upholding this commitment; I was also worried that it would harm my friendships with the other group members, who were some of my best friends. However, I knew it was the right decision for me and for the group, and I don’t regret it.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My most pressing concern is definitely Kelly. She might have a medical condition that needs to be addressed immediately. I would pay close attention to how much she was eating, and if she didn’t seem to be getting enough nutrition I would talk to her about it. If her condition seemed like an eating disorder, I would explain to her that she was burning a lot more calories while hiking and being out in the cold, and that she could get seriously ill if she didn’t eat more. If the problem seemed to be something different, then I would ask more questions about her health. If she seemed seriously sick, then I would find the best way for her to get medical attention, whether that were calling an ambulance from the campground or finding the nearest road; continuing to subject her to the elements could exacerbate her illness.
	My next concern would be Renee: although she isn’t in danger of bodily harm, she doesn’t seem to be enjoying herself very much, and her feeling alienated by Lizzie and Matilda could really start off her college experience negatively. However, she would probably be embarrassed if I tried to encourage her not to be bothered by Lizzie and Matilda talking about their luxurious childhoods. Instead, I would try other methods to get her to have fun and connect with the other members of the group. I would engage her in conversations while she was hiking behind me; I would ask her about what she did at home without making her feel uncomfortable, and demonstrate a genuine interest in her past and interests, even if they weren’t as lavish as the other girls’. 
	My third concern would be Peter. Although his annoyance at Phillip’s bragging is understandable, it’s really important for leaders to do everything they can to make the trip a positive experience for FOPpers. If Phillip realized that Peter, whom he clearly admires, was mocking him, it might really upset him and detract significantly from the trip for him. I would just warn Peter to keep any negative thoughts about the FOPpers to himself; I’m sure he would understand, and make an effort to be nice to Phillip from then on.]]></Q7.5>

Before my own FOP trip in August 2013, I had never really had a real outdoor experience. Although I have been camping with my family and with cabin mates at overnight camps, I really wanted a genuine experience living and backpacking outdoors. In the past, my camping trips were limited to staying at campsite with running water and electricity, or in tents near cabins and other amenities. I guess my desire for genuine exposure to the outdoors stems from my strong wish to try something new. All throughout high school, I found myself confined to the school, or the library and the laboratory that I worked at. At the end of high school, I wanted a change in environment. And I did, I escaped the concrete jungle of my city by playing ultimate frisbee. Though my escape was momentary, I really enjoyed the outdoor activity and I genuinely felt happier. Perhaps, it was because I enjoyed the physical exertion or because I enjoyed exploring my limits and my surroundings. I don't fully understand it even now; however, this love made me apply to be FOPper last summer and it was definitely one of the best decisions that I have made this year. 

I felt happier on FOP. I enjoyed my surroundings. I enjoyed the daily challenges. I forced myself to try harder, do better and be stronger. I enjoyed exploring my environment and most of all, I enjoyed the interactions that I have made throughout my FOP trip with my classmates and my FOP leaders. I felt inspired by their stories and life experiences, and the friendships that we have made are genuine. I thoroughly enjoyed my FOP trip and I am inspired to help make the experiences of other FOPpers next year just as amazing as mine. ]]></Q6.1>

		<Q7.2>Three strengths that I can bring to my FOP leading include my communication skills, attention to detail, and empathy. While on FOP, I learned how to communicate more effectively through team-building activities and on the trail, building on my communication skills that I have gained from the student leadership council, peer tutoring committee, and the science club. On FOP, I practiced these skills constantly, for example, when setting up the tarp, I helped to teach others how to tie "ghosties" and "trucker's hitches". Furthermore, I learned how important attention to detail is through my FOP trip. Each day, I watched my leaders, Jackie and Ross, carefully plan out the trail, where to get water and where to camp. This inspired me to build on my ability to focus on details that I gained from working at the pool and running school-wide events. On my trip, this trait helped to better prepare me, for example, I had packed an extra bowl and a multi-tool, which later came in handy on the trip. Finally, the empathy and understanding that my FOP leaders showed really motivated me to try to be a better person. Like them, I tried to help my fellow FOPpers by spotting them on steep mountain paths and switching sleep places with another FOPper when it was raining and a puddle had formed where she was sleeping. These traits that I have developed and am still strengthening will prepare me for leading a group of eager FOPpers.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>I think the greatest challenge that I will face is helping my FOPpers get to know each other and break the awkward silence. From my own high school transition experience and my memories of organizing freshman orientation each year in high school, I understand how difficult living and learning in a new environment can be. Ice breaker games that I have learned through organizing freshman orientation will help to get them talking and interacting with each other. I believe this is a key step in helping to these freshman to transition to college. Throughout the trip, I am inspired by my FOP leaders to make conversation and talk with my FOPpers. This helps to not only to put them at ease in a new environment but also allows them to ask me questions about my college experience. I feel like my age, as an in-coming sophomore, would also help them to transition into college and talk more due to the smaller age gap. I will be able to better share my own college experiences with them. While I am tempted to share my own FOP experiences with my FOPpers on day one, I want them to create their own memories as well. Another challenge that I foresee is alienating my FOPpers by being too overbearing or strict. I tend to take my role and responsibility very seriously but that can interfere with helping my FOPpers open up to each other. Balance is crucial between my role as a FOP leader and my role as a mentor or friend. </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>I look back at my choice to apply to the US for college. As an international student from Canada, I was daunted with the prospect of applying to the states because it seemed near impossible. Very few Canadian students were accepted by schools, like Harvard; in fact, no one had been accepted from my school recently. At the time, I had two choices: go to a Canadian university and have a normal high school life, or make the necessary sacrifices and push myself to work harder to try to get into a US college. While the decision seemed , I had a difficult choice to make; I wasn't prepared to forsake my social life and leave my friends. I wasn't prepared to devote time and effort to prepare for testing. This internal conflict led me to create lists to compare the pros and cons of both of my options. In the end, I looked at how happy I would be with each decision. With studying in Canada, I didn't have to work as hard; I would be happier in the moment. Preparing to study in the US, I would be working harder but I would be happier with the end outcome, I assumed. At the start of sophomore year, I chose to apply to US colleges, and I am glad now with that decision. Looking back, I do regret sacrificing time that could have spent with then-close friends; however, I am amazed by the persistence of our friendships.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[After reading the excerpt, I have several concerns, all of which can be remediated by clear communication and novel ideas. For one, I strongly believe that efficient communication is needed between FOP leaders. I plan to check in with my partner every night before the next day to debrief, plan out the the trail and read the map together to ensure that we don't miss important junctions or subtle trail branches. In this case, it will not only ensure that we do arrive on time the next day (have enough time to camp) but also avoid the Gage Caves during our scenic hike. 

Next, I want to alleviate the group dynamic between Lizzie, Matilda and Renee. It seems that talking about upbringings has caused Renee to be uncomfortable. I can foresee two possible remedies for this problem. First, I can try to maintain the current hiking order but try to introduce a new topics of discussion, such as favorite bands, movies, or books. This will not only help to alleviate some potentially uncomfortable topics of discussions, but also help the FOPpers get to know each other better. If I observe the same problems persisting throughout the day, I will try to implement a hiking order, by birthday, or last name, or shoe size. Not only would this help to eliminate tension in the group by giving my FOPpers a chance to talk to new people, but also help them grow as a group. I could ell them to get into hiking order by shoe size without speaking to one another, forcing them to use teamwork to get into hiking order. The combination of these strategies can help to alleviate friction between Renee and Matilda and Lizzie. This would also help to get Kelly and Jack more comfortable with interacting with the other FOPpers, as well as get Phillip talking with his other classmates. 
I can see that Suzy has a crush on Mark. I think the best that I can do to prevent sexual activity, but not a potentially good relationship is remind my FOPpers there is "No Hop On FOP!" by singing the "No Hop On FOP!" song with Peter (my own FOP leader Ross performed this for my trip, it was great). Next, I want to encourage the FOPpers to get involved with daily tasks like setting up tarps or sumping after dinner. I believe that a FOP group that works together is happier together. 
Finally, I want to ensure that everyone is well-rested and feeling physically-well before heading out on the hike. I plan to tell the FOPpers to go to bed earlier tonight and before going to bed, do some "personal care", such as checking for blisters and applying moleskin or gauze. Before going to bed, I plan to talk briefly with Peter about personal attitude. In particular, I am worried about his eye roll at Phillip. While I won't accuse him of doing anything wrong, I want to, during the debrief, just remind him about the positivity that FOP leaders have to show in an effort to inspire and motivate the FOPpers. I hope that the next day and the remainder of the trip go well!]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2>My main strength is in the experience I have had living in the backcountry, leading and working with a group of my peers. I spent four and a half months in the last year camping in the backcountry with people between the ages of 18 and 24. I am very confident in my camp craft, navigation, packing, and technical backcountry skills, and also feel very comfortable teaching these skills to others who are less experienced. This past summer I used my NOLS experience to help my fellow conservation corps members pack efficiently, deal with blistered feet, and set up tents and tarps.  I also think my NOLS experience will be especially valuable because it gave me experience with leading a group through the wilderness with no adults. NOLS gave me a sense of what it takes to keep a group working together, what it is like to make difficult decisions in the backcountry, and how to maintain a leadership position around people who are essentially your peers. Additionally, since most of my backcountry experience has come within the last year, I remember very clearly what it is like to be new inexperienced in the outdoors. I think this will allow me to relate to FOPpers who are new to the backcountry and are a little uncomfortable with spending a week in the woods. Finally, I think the experience I will gain leading with the Harvard Outing Club next semester will be very useful for FOP.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My greatest challenge would probably lie in dealing with FOPpers who have negative attitudes. I feel that while it is fairly straightforward to teach someone an outdoor skill, it is a lot harder to change a person’s attitude, and attitude problems can lead to worse outcomes than technical mistakes. I have seen firsthand how one person with a negative attitude can hamper the accomplishments of a trip and bring everyone else down.  Maintaining a positive environment is critical in ensuring that the participants on the trip have the best experience possible. The worst case I can imagine, outside of an injury, is a trip in which negative attitudes reduce the FOP experience to six days of complaining in the woods. Luckily, I have had some experience improving attitudes in participants on outdoor trips. One of the most important things I learned on NOLS was the value of self-care. Not allowing blisters to form, staying hydrated, and walking with a comfortable pack all go a long way towards keeping an inexperienced camper happy. Trail games and riddles are also great ways to keep the group in good spirits. Additionally, as a leader it is imperative to maintain open communication with all members of the group and be receptive of feedback. Often times, the reason for a bad attitude can be uncovered and addressed by talking about it. By paying attention to the participants, keeping the mood up, and communicating frequently with participants, this problem can be prevented and mitigated.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[During the canyon section of my NOLS semester I was leading a group of four guys through the wilderness without any instructors. Our goal for the day was to navigate to a predetermined location (the “x”) at the bottom of a canyon to reconvene with our instructors and prepare for our solos (two days alone). Unfortunately for us, when we reached the canyon we found it surrounded by two hundred foot cliffs. We could not find a way down and darkness was about two or three hours away. We were also out of water. I weighed these factors and decided to give up on looking for a way down (a decisions which drew some hostility and disagreement), find a camp site and water before dark, and prepare to scout the next day. I figured that attempting to find a way down cliffs in the dark could get us stranded or worse, someone could fall. I also considered the fact that this was the first time that we were not going to make the “x” during our two months in NOLS, and that while failing to reach the “x” was not ideal, it was still not worth attempting a dangerous night time descent, especially after a full day of hiking. We spent the night outside of the canyon and eventually found a way down the next day. Although this decision seems straightforward now, the fact that my group mates wanted to descend made this a much more difficult choice to make.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The most immediate concern I have with this situation is the account of Kelly shivering during breaks and not eating her cookies and dessert. Eating enough calories is much more important while hiking than it is in the front country because it is essential have fuel while doing vigorous physical exercise. Kelly is already displaying signs of a calorie deficiency with her shivering, and if the deficit continues to grow she could become cranky, irritable, and bring the group down. She could also stumble or do something that could lead to an injury. If I was in charge of this trip I would emphasize this fact to Kelly, and encourage her to eat her snacks, even if she doesn't normally. I would explain that the nicest thing she can do is take care of her own needs. I would also emphasize the importance of self-care at the beginning of the trip and throughout when situations such as this arise. 
	My second concern is with Mark and with how much work he is doing. While there is nothing wrong with a participant who likes to help, helpful participants can sometimes feel shoehorned into the role of “helper,” where they feel that the group needs them to take more weight or volunteer even if they don’t want to. Additionally, his constant volunteering might inhibit other, shier FOPpers from learning how to do backcountry tasks like setting up tarps or cooking. I would talk to Mark and make sure that he understands that he doesn't have to do so much extra work in order for the trip to succeed, and suggest that he do a little less in order for himself and the others to have a more well -rounded experience.
	My most important concern, however, is the seeming lack of communication between me and my fellow FOP leader, Peter. I am uncomfortable with the idea of him getting us lost because I should have been an active participant in navigation. As I leader I should have been looking at a map and verifying that Peter’s navigation is correct. Doing this, even if I am not the one in front, is one of my main responsibilities. Additionally, Peter’s competition when we get to camp seems like it takes me by surprise. As I fellow leader, I would like to be consulted about potential activities before they are announced. I think more communication between Peter and me would be very beneficial, as it would reduce navigation errors, allow for a review of planned activities, and maintain a sense of unity as a leadership team. I would explain this to Peter, and make an active effort to increase communication.

		<Q6.1>Summer 2007, 2008, 2009: YMCA Camp Hi-Rock overnight camping trips. I was a camper and every session of camp included an overnight trip into the woods, which I looked forward to every year.
Lifetime: Day hikes in wildlife reserves with my family and friends. I enthusiastically participated with my family and, once I could drive, I started bringing my friends to go on different days because I enjoyed it so much.
Lifetime: Day kayak trips with my extended family while spending summers on Brandy Pond in Maine. I helped make lunches and plan our routes.
Summer 2013: FOP, backpacking C trip. I loved it!
Fall 2013: WOOP. I loved WOOP as well!

Although I have little outdoor overnight experience, I am excited to learn new skills, spend more time outdoors and teach others what I learn. Since I was a young child I have always loved nature. I have always felt at home outdoors and love spending time in the woods. My family did not go on camping trips or stayed in the woods for extended periods of time in my childhood but we often went on long walks in the woods, which fostered my love of the natural world. I would love to learn more outdoor skills so that I would be better equipped to go on longer trips and spend more time in nature. 
</Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Fall and Spring seasons 2007-2013: TOPSoccer volunteer. I volunteered at a soccer clinic for children with special needs once a week during the fall and spring seasons. 
Summer 2009-2013: Elite Soccer Camp counselor. I was a counselor at a soccer camp, where I worked with children from ages 5-11. During camp, I both ran activities with the full group (30-50) of children and taught individual skill sessions (10-15 children) to different age groups.
2009-2013: Best Buddies. I was in a one-on-one pairing with an individual with special needs. We talked weekly and did activities every month.
Spring 2011: As part of an Introduction to Special Education class in school, I volunteered in special needs classrooms twice a week. I helped during math time and reading time, during which I helped individuals one-on-one.
Spring 2011: Track assistant. I worked one-on-one at a track clinic with a child who has autism. 
2010-2013: Class Council representative. A position elected by my 500-person class, we organized class dances, spirit weeks, and fundraisers. 
Summer 2012: Coaches Across Continents. I volunteered for a non-profit organization that uses soccer to teach life lessons (including gender equity, health and wellness, and leadership) in third-world countries. I spent five weeks in Zimbabwe and Zambia working with over 100 local coaches and teachers, teaching them how to implement this curriculum into their programs.
Winter 2012-2013: Indoor Track and Field captain. I was elected captain by a team of 80 girls. I ran warm-ups, checked in with each individually, worked with my co-captains to support and motivate the team, and met with the coach to assess the team’s needs.
Spring 2013: Outdoor Track and Field captain. I was elected captain by a team of over 100 girls. I ran warm-ups, checked in with each individually and worked with my co-captains to support and motivate the team, and met with the coach to assess the team’s needs.

		<Q7.2>In a group setting, I am very aware of how individuals are feeling and am able to make sure that everyone is involved and included. I am also good at keeping a group of people focused and getting things done in a timely manner, while still having fun. Having been a camp counselor, I am able to follow a curriculum while keeping a sense of humor, and I have the ability to be flexible as situations arise. I am calm and steady during emergencies and have had CPR training. I am easy to talk to, very approachable, and am able to help people feel included and welcome. This would help first-years feel comfortable talking to me about any concerns they have about the upcoming year. I am also very open-minded and love hearing about different experiences, which would make it easy to have conversations with a very diverse FOP group. I am very chipper and always have a positive attitude.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[One of my greatest challenges in leading a group of first-year students would be that at times I can be a bit too “understanding” and let people get away with things that I should not. I tend to try to protect people from things when I know that people are struggling or have a difficult background story. As a leader I know that it is important to let others know that they have responsibilities too. Sometimes I feel like I will “burden” them if I know they are having issues although I do know that responsibility can help others feel more welcome and involved. Walking the line between “friend” mode and “leader” mode, between enabling or supporting individual growth, is something I consciously work on. I may also have difficulty delegating tasks at times because I do not want people to feel that I am not doing my job or that they are being given too much to do. This sometimes results in me having to do more than my fair share of the work in a group.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>At the end of my sophomore soccer season, I had to make the difficult decision of whether or not I should continue to play soccer the next year. That season, the school coach had constantly belittled me and made me feel inferior to the rest of the players, and I went home from practice nearly every day crying. Although considered a strict coach overall, even the rest of my team agreed he seemed to dislike me very strongly for no apparent reason. At the end of my season, I began to reevaluate whether or not I wanted to continue to play under him. In considering this decision, I had to consider not just the coach but the team and the sport itself. Some of my best friends were on the team, who without practice every day I would rarely see. The team also did many bonding activities and fostered a sense of community off the field, without interaction with the coach. I have been playing soccer my entire life, and giving up this team would mean giving up a huge part of my life. I chose to stay with soccer for these reasons, and although the next year was quite difficult on the field, I came away with very close friends and the knowledge that I could face adversity and still be able to find the best in any situation. I learned that I cannot let one person impact my entire life.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[There are many aspects of this day that concern me, but a few stand out as more important than the others. One of my concerns is about Renee, who has become much more withdrawn than she was before. This is concerning because her withdrawal from conversation and interaction may mean that she is feeling left out because she did not have the same type of upbringing as the other two girls. I would react by trying to have a one-on-one conversation with Renee or bring her into conversation with some of the other FOPpers. I also would attempt to engage the three girls in a conversation on a different topic that they all would be interested in and feel comfortable about. Another of my concerns is about Kelly, who does not interact with the other FOPpers and shivers and does not eat all the food she needs to. Hiking is extremely physically exerting and you need to have enough calories in order to sustain that level of activity, so it is concerning that she does not eat all the food she should. It is also concerning that she does not interact with the other FOPpers because she may not be getting the most out of the trip. I would react by trying to engage Kelly in conversation, either just the two of us or in a group with other FOPpers. I would also try to make sure that she is eating and make sure that she is wearing enough layers. Another important concern about the trip that I have is that Phillip does not seem to want to interact with his peers. This is a concern because he is about to start a school year with these people and he must be able to interact with them as his peers, even though he feels superior to them through his age and experience. In order to address this, I would talk to Peter, with whom Phillip is usually talking, and see if he can help encourage Phillip to interact with the other FOPpers. I would also attempt to bring Phillip into conversations with other FOPpers. In addition, I would talk to Phillip about how he can use what he sees as maturity to help the other FOPpers transition by being there for them and supporting their experiences, and also help him keep in mind that other people have had very different experiences that he can learn from even when he feels more mature. By validating Phillip and giving him a positive goal and a feeling of responsibility, Phillip’s actions can be made less irritating to my co-leader and can be focused in a positive way. This will also help him have better interactions with his peers.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[As someone who came into Harvard having no idea what to study, I had to think a lot about the different paths available to Harvard students, both academically and socially. It meant I struggled to find my place freshman year, but it also meant that I gave a lot of thought to the questions so many freshmen must answer once they actually start school. I pride myself on being a thoughtful and introspective person, and a good active listener. From sailing and other adventures I know I react calmly and decisively in times of pressure or duress, but am very relaxed and easygoing unless something goes wrong. My high school had a mandatory 2-hour-per-week class called ‘Lifeskills,’ which was essentially fuzzy cheesecake but in a classroom, so I’m really used to being open and hopefully good at continuing a conversation and not letting things get awkward. Also one of the things that makes me happiest is getting to know new people in a real way, which is why I loved doing FOP so much. Every summer I’ve gone to Cape Cod with my huge extended family—an experience which taught me how important it is to have fun. Guests come all the time, and I’ve had extensive conversations with my cousins about the best way to have them feel like a part of the crowd even when everyone else is related, so I think I’ve become much better at making people feel comfortable. Lastly, I’m an extremely open person; even with strangers I have few secrets. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I can be somewhat foolhardy, especially when outside. My spontaneity has bordered on recklessness, and I honestly abhor rules when I’m hiking and in the outdoors (though I completely understand their necessity on things like FOP). My school had a strong outdoors program but I chose not to do any trips in high school because I was so bothered by the lack of freedom, and that could potentially make me frustrated with FOP’s level of control. As a History concentrator I know very little about premed requirements and lab courses, which is something I remember came up on my FOP trip several times. Additionally, though final clubs play a relatively small role on the campus as a whole, they play a comparably large part in my life and the lives of my friends. Final clubs are understandably notorious and can be really limiting in that they restrict your social network and decrease the diversity of one’s social circle within Harvard. I’m happy to be a part of one, but I’m aware that it means I know less about other social experiences at Harvard, and therefore might have a hard time painting a picture of what Harvard means to so many students. Also I am extremely forgetful and disorganized. I can usually buckle down and force myself to get on top of stuff but am remarkably spacey sometimes. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Last year, after a lot of stress and miscommunication, my friends and I ended up having nine people in our tentative blocking group. As one of the original members of the group and the only person who knew all the others, I had to work with everyone to decide what to do. We were broken down into a couple overlapping groups, and ended up having to decide whether to force out two guys who had paired up, three girls who had done the same, or a single guy who wasn’t sure he had anyone else to live with. We talked all together, but because everyone was trying to be careful it was not very helpful. I tried to talk to everyone individually to see what people really thought and how different blocking groups would live together. It became increasingly obvious that the one student who could end up as a floater was the least integrated. I had to decide, with my roommate, how to approach the situation, keeping in mind that the longer we took to decide the less time he/she/they would have to look for other groups. We ended up having to weigh the collective against the individual, and decided that it was not worth forcing some people to live with a stranger just to avoid a potentially awkward circumstance for him, and then agreed to work together to find a place for him in another blocking group, which luckily we were able to do.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The most pressing concern to me seems to be that Renee has been uncomfortable with her peers since they started talking about signs of wealth. I’ve personally seen differences in economic backgrounds generate tension at Harvard to an extent unmatched by other social dividers. Wealth can become a very real insecurity at universities with such a wide range of income stability, and my first priority would be to make sure Renee does not feel left out because of where she comes from. As interesting as Luxembourg may be, I have found that most students are genuinely interested in hearing about places very different than the ones they came from. I would try to get Renee talking about Missouri and what her hometown/school were like, and try to integrate Lizzie and Matilda into that conversation. If they continued to show disinterest I’d tell everyone to try and talk to someone they had not talked much to yet, and hopefully Renee could find some common ground with one of the other FOPpers.
Philip’s distance from his peers is also problematic. His apparent belief that he is ‘above’ Daniel is my second biggest concern. Students looking up to other students should be expected, but Philip should handle Daniel’s respect with more maturity and mutual respect. Since Philip looks up to Peter, I’d talk to Peter and listen to his ideas about the matter, and then most likely recommend that Peter try to redirect questions towards Daniel, so if Philip talked about backpacking, have Peter ask Daniel if he’s been camping before, or what he thinks about it now. 
The third issue that stands out to me is that Kelly is shivering and being so quiet. Depending on the severity of her shivering this could be by far the most pressing concern, given that physical well being and safety are the most important things when in a remote setting. I would try to talk to her alone at camp, without drawing too much attention to us to make sure she was getting enough to eat and really was healthy. The previously mentioned switching of hiking order could potentially get both Kelly and Jack to talk more. Some kids are just naturally quieter, so this is not necessarily a huge issue, but I would also try to play games like ghost so even if a FOPper did not want to talk about themselves, they would still had opportunities for expression. Talking, even with silly games, might open the door and get everyone to open up. For a FOP trip to be truly successful, it’s important for the group to not break down into cliques. People are bound to connect more to some than others, but my hope is these steps would not just fix the problems of individuals, but would help break down the apparent barriers to ensure that any given student felt comfortable in a particular role within the group.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[I have not had many outdoor experiences. In middle school, I would go on one to two three day hiking trips in New Hampshire but did not have any experiences since then until my FOP trip in the summer of 2013 at Camp Dodge in New Hampshire. I was on the A/B service trip, where we both worked on cleaning trails and backpacked for a few days. Despite my lack of previous outdoor trips, I am very excited for the opportunity to gain greater familiarity with the outdoors. On my FOP trip, I realized what an amazing environment the backcountry is as my group members and I attempted to learn more about each other and create connections. While we could have done our processing activities back in the Harvard dorms and still have benefitted from them, in the backcountry everything else fell away, from our day-to-day worries to any persona we felt like we had to keep up, and we were truly able to be ourselves. I really loved learning about the outdoors on my trip and I would love to expand this knowledge and familiarity. I realized that I had the ability to live on my own, from making my own shelter to helping cook my own food. It felt so empowering to be self-sufficient and I believe this feeling would only grow if I gained the knowledge to actually lead a trip.]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2>Chenery Middle School Camps, Summer 2011: I worked with a group of preschoolers in a day camp setting and led arts-and-crafts activities, sports, and games. I learned about responsibility and how to keep a group of children entertained and safe.
Youth Basketball Coach and Clinic Organizer, 2009-2013: I coached students in 3rd-8th grade, taught basketball skills and teamwork, and helped organize various clinics throughout the school year. These experiences helped me learn how to teach a group of students a set of skills while also making sure they have fun.
Internship in the External Relations Department of the Musuem of Fine Arts, Summer 2012: I helped out with office tasks, alumni relations and special projects. This job helped me learn how to think on my feet and take on responsibilities that I did not necessarily have experience before.
Class Connector at Belmont High School, 2010-2012: I gave tours of our high school and had lunch with a group of incoming freshman on the first day of school in order to answer any questions they had. This experience helped me learn how to honestly give advice and help others become comfortable in a new situation.
City Step, Fall 20120-Present: In CityStep, I teach about dance, teamwork and creativity to a group of sixth-graders at a local Cambridge school. So far this experience has helped me learn how to mentor and teach a group of children, and how to be confident and comfortable with myself in order to teach others to be the same.

		<Q7.2>I think one of my greatest strengths would be my ability to be silly or put myself out there in order to make other people more comfortable and willing to do the same. I grew a lot in high school, from a shy, desperate-to-please friend to a confident person who learned that you can make people happy by just being happy yourself. I think on FOP I would be willing and excited to draw my FOPpers into the moment and encourage them to show who they truly are. Along with making people comfortable, I feel I can be very honest about my life and my experiences at Harvard. I feel I have learned a lot in the past four months and would love the opportunity to share this with incoming first-years. I am also very excited about this trip because I had an amazing experience on my own FOP trip. I have seen the connections and security a FOP trip can give someone, and I now feel more prepared to recreate a similar environment in a new trip. Finally, I feel I am very responsible. While I would love for all my FOPpers to gain friendships and information about Harvard, I have been in enough teaching situations to know that health and safety are the first priorities, and I have experience dealing with stressful situations so that I can think on my feet and create a safe environment.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>One of the things I would be most worried about on a FOP trip is my lack of wilderness experience. It is a little intimidating to lead a group of college students into an isolated environment. However, I have a great gain familiarity with the backcountry and the motivation to learn and practice all the skills I would need. I also have never had such a structured experience teaching people who are so close to me in age. Through CityStep and the community service I did in high school, I have lots of experience with programs where the goal is to teach children a skill while helping them learn about themselves and have fun. Through my Connectors program at my high school I have some experience with relating to my peers and addressing concerns they have about entering a new environment. However, combining these two experiences into a FOP trip would be a new situation in which I would have to think on my feet in order to adjust. Finally, I am slightly worried about creating deep and lasting connections with people who come from such diverse backgrounds that I may not necessarily have first-hand knowledge of. However, already in my time at Harvard I have met people from all kinds of cultural and social backgrounds and am greatly enjoying getting to know them and learning from them.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>One difficult decision I had to make was choosing my extracurricular activities upon entering high school. I had been involved with both sports and drama in high school and enjoyed them both for very different reasons. I had been swimming and playing basketball since elementary school. I loved the challenge of pushing myself to compete at a higher and higher level, and had put a lot of time into both of these sports. I had pursued drama at a less intense level but truly enjoyed the rush of being onstage and spending time with my friends. I ultimately chose sports because I did not want to waste all of the time I had put into these activities in the past, and was glad that I had an activity at which I could truly excel. While I enjoyed my experiences on both the basketball and swim teams, I wish I had thought more about the effect each of these activities would have had on me. Through sports I learned about discipline and hard work, but since I was a not good friend with anyone on the team I also felt isolated. I believe that through drama I could have gained more confidence in myself earlier on in school, instead of fighting a four-year battle to accept who I was and become confident enough to show my true self to other people.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern would be to assess everyone’s health and safety. The two people I notice who may not be acting safely are Kelly and Mark. Kelly is not eating very much and also seems to not be comfortable enough to tell one of the leaders if she does not feel healthy or comfortable. Mark has been carrying more than his share of weight, which may not be a problem at this point but could affect his safety in the future, especially with a day of heavy hiking approaching. First I would talk to my co-leader Peter to see if he has noticed the same things and whether he has talked to either FOPper and has more information. Then I would most likely casually check-in with each person, see how they are doing and make sure they know that someone is looking out for them and that their first priority is to stay safe and healthy so that everyone on the trip can have fun. Finally, if they are not very responsive in a one-on-one chat and I do not want to directly confront them about my concerns, I would casually remind the group about staying healthy and safe, referring to things we had hopefully gone over before the trip, so that I would not have to single anyone out directly. If either of these issues became more of a problem I would definitely have a more direct conversation with each of the FOPpers. My second concern would be about the kids who seem withdrawn or isolated, such as Renee, Kelly and Jack. Again I would talk to Peter to see if he notices the same things or has any greater insight about how we could improve their experience. Then, I would give them more on-on-one attention on and off the trail. I remember from my trip how excited I felt when a leader had a conversation with me and seemed genuinely interested in learning about my life and giving advice. I would make more of an effort to walk with them and, by sharing things about my own life, hopefully encourage them to open up to me, and pull them into conversation with other FOPpers once they began feeling more comfortable. Another concern I have is about the interactions between Daniel, Phillip and Peter. It seems like Daniel and Phillip are in fragile places and could easily become dismayed if they learned the person they admire does not return the sentiment. I would again first bring this up with Peter and see what he thinks. Then I would probably encourage him to talk to Daniel, which would hopefully draw Phillip into that conversation as well while maybe causing Phillip to hold Daniel in higher esteem.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[•	 2010-2012 Fall: Varsity High School Soccer
o	This definitely did not occur in a remote setting, but as a goalie and a captain of a very diverse team, I learned an incredible amount about directing and communicating effectively in order to help my team, which I think would be very applicable to a FOP setting
•	2012-2013: High School Outing Club/Ski Club
o	Enthusiastically participated in the many trips we went on between my junior and senior years when I was not in a sports season including rock gym trips, night skiing trips, and even slack lining trips. Personal favorite was definitely open-water sea kayaking though where I played a role in recruiting kids for the trip and helping plan logistical things with the club organizer

Nonetheless, I would probably characterize my outdoors experience as little at least as it applies to a FOP setting. But having grown up on the coast of Maine, skiing in its mountains during the winter and swimming in its oceans and lakes, I know I would fervently try to learn the ins-and-outs of the backcountry so I could learn a bit more about it myself, but more importantly be able to teach others about the area I’ve been so lucky to grow up in/near. I know during the times where I have had the pleasure to hike in the mountains, just a wonderful feeling of relaxation and thoughtfulness comes over me, and if learning more outdoor skills allows me to experience that to a greater extent, I am most definitely down to learn those skills. Also, I am a strong supporter of being a renaissance woman/man, and even though in this age most people do not need to know how to set up a tent or pitch a bear line, I see the value in being able to do many different things in different settings. Just because we do not need to be outside, does not mean we shouldn’t go outside, and it’s often the outdoors where you learn a ton that you can apply back to life in the “frontcountry”. I believe being in the outdoors with FOP could provide me with the right state of mind to lead a more effective life back here in Cambridge. Ultimately, then I will be able to teach other first-years to see the benefits in relaxing and thinking in the back country in order to improve their lives in the frontcountry.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Although I’m just a white guy from Maine, I feel I have a solid ability to relate to a diversity of young people. This ability I think originates from the high school I went to, which is probably 1000% more diverse than the rest of Maine, but it was also very open and welcoming so I became friends with kids from all over the world from Burundi to El Salvador. I believe you learn a lot by chatting with people from different places and who have different interests than you, and I know I would be comfortable having similar conversations with first-year’s on FOP. Whether a first-year is from New England or England, plays in the band or on the football team, is into computer science or government, I know I could have a pretty interesting conversation with them. Even if I do not have similar interests as someone, I will make sure to ask questions and find out about their interests. That’s how you learn more about people and even things about yourself.
	I think another positive trait gained from the community I grew up in is that I will always have a positive attitude, and for many people, that attitude can be contagious. I am incredibly thankful for the young-adulthood I have had, and whether it’s snowing or 90 degrees, I always look on the bright side of life. By engaging people in conversation or leading by example, I think I can spread that optimistic attitude as well.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I would characterize myself as an introvert rather than someone who’s totally outgoing. In such an intensely intimate social group like a FOP trip, this could be a small problem. Sometimes it just takes time for me to come out of my shell and relax. I know it definitely took a little bit of time on my own FOP trip. Unfortunately in this time period of introversion, I’m a bit timid at telling people what I really think. Nonetheless, I think I can work on limiting that time period. Having had a super outgoing FOP leader and one who was more reserved does not make me worry too much about this, but it is something I should keep in mind.
	Similar to being an introvert, I also would say sometimes I avoid talking about difficult things in life. I often use conversation to avoid the most important things at hand. I don’t think I don’t talk about obviously important things like if a FOPer had an injury or even if I was recognizing a conflict in the group dynamic, but it’s more talking about the problems I’m having in my life. Even if these internal conflicts were not hurting my FOP group, I believe I find it easier to put my problems out there when everyone is talking about their problems as we did at the end of the day. It’s much easier to talk about the problems you’re having when you know others aren’t having a perfect day either.
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Beginning college, I was unsure of what I wanted to do outside classes. I played soccer a lot during high school and spoke with the club captain over the summer so I was leaning pretty heavily toward trying out for the club team. Somehow though I ended up auditioning and getting into a solid a cappella group on campus. Compared to playing with my soccer bros, the dynamic in the group was completely different. As six-hour rehearsals waned on, I quickly found myself doubting whether I had found the right group for me. At one point, I thought I’d made a pretty final decision not to continue with the group after the year.
	Nonetheless, I remained calm taking time to think about the pros and cons of being in the group. I spoke with friends from home about what I liked and disliked about the group. Before I made any final decisions, I wanted to make sure I understood any ramifications. Finally, I decided I’d stay in the group. Besides finding out that people in the group were actually awesome and not insane, I learned a lot about myself in the decision-making process. It’s difficult being in an intensely new environment you’re not accustomed to. You find yourself doubting yourself. But I believe I am learning a lot about myself being outside my comfort zone. Although it has not always been the best of times, I made the decision to learn something new about myself and grow as a person.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	Although it’s easy to discount the small bit of information on Kelly and Jack, it’s as important to address as any other issue. It’s possible both are having a solid FOP experience and are just taking their time becoming comfortable with the group. Nonetheless, it’s impossible to surely know if they will feel their FOP group will help support them once back on campus. The only way to ensure they feel they have an outlet back on campus is continuously trying to involve everyone with group activities and/or conversation. This probably applies to more than just the shy FOPers, but it cannot be emphasized enough that fun activities and conversation can make FOPers feel more included. If not too late, you could lead a trip down to a stream for everyone to dunk in before dinner. Or even a casual conversation about music tastes over dinner can lead to everyone feeling more included. As long as many opportunities for conversation and fun activities are provided, Kelly and Jack will eventually feel comfortable with the group.
	The interactions between Daniel, Phillip, and Peter are also troubling because they could easily be detrimental to the group dynamic. Firstly, Daniel’s mentioning of “getting trashed” is a bit concerning as phrases like these can quickly polarize FOPers’ views of the college social scene. A helpful post-dinner discussion could include talking about how plenty of social outlets on campus exist whether you want to be sober or not. Most importantly to deal with are the subtle judgmental insinuations made by Phillip. By believing that he is more mature than the rest of his FOP group, Phillip greatly risks polarizing himself from the rest of the group and losing the support system. In order to encourage Phillip to realize his fellow FOPers might have more in common with him than he thinks, you could incentivize learning something new from a FOPer he hasn’t talked to yet. Hopefully, a full-value contract was made at trip’s beginning and “no judging” was included. Lastly, chatting with Peter reminding him to refrain from judging FOPers would also be a good idea.
	Probably what concerns me most is seeing Renee slowly become more reclusive as the trip endures. This is a dangerous trend, and if not addressed, could leave Renee feeling that FOP hurt her settling into college. Also, as great as it is that Lizzie and Matilda are having a great time with each other, often the most challenging parts of settling into the social scene in college is being able to get to know people who have contrary likes personalities than yourself. In order to encourage all three FOPers to branch out and have less exclusive relationships, again you could incentivize learning something new from a FOPer they haven’t talked to yet. Even if Renee does not become the closest of friends with Lizzie and Matilda, finding someone new to talk to can help her open up more instead of sticking to short responses as she is currently doing.

Summer 2013: I spent 2 months in a Tanzania (specifically a tiny village called Tsamasi...close to Babati but otherwise way too small to find on a map) teaching HIV/AIDS prevention and education to the village. I was in my village with one other American girl and two Tanzanian teaching partners, and we taught everyone from students in the primary school to teenagers on the soccer team to the adults at village meetings.

		<Q6.3>The teaching experience that I gained this past summer helped me learn a lot about how to relate to very diverse groups of people; not only was I teaching in another country, I spent time working with and teaching people of all ages. I learned better how to work in a group as I had to rely on my fellow teaching partners for support so that our teachings went smoothly. I also gained outdoor experience when I climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro. We spent our days climbing and our nights sleeping in tents and I learned a lot about the importance of safety and taking the proper precautions when climbing- especially at high elevations. I also learned about reading your own body's signals because I experienced pulmonary edema, where your lungs essentially fill with fluid which can be very dangerous at high altitudes; I had to listen to my body and my guides and stay at base camp instead of summiting as they explained that the risk of death was a very real concern if I continued to climb. My experience on the mountain would definitely help me to relate to all different kinds of hikers and skills levels.</Q6.3>

		<Q7.2>	I feel that I would be good at getting a group of freshmen to work well together. As the second child of four I am used to dealing with conflicting opinions and have a lifetime of practice looking at issues from different perspectives and finding solutions to help everyone get along. I think I am easily-approachable so that the freshmen would feel comfortable coming to me with any difficulties or concerns, but at the same time I have no problem being decisive and ensuring that important tasks get accomplished as they should. As a lifeguard of four years I have been trained to stay calm under pressure feel comfortable handling any safety situations that may arise.I love being outside and am excited about potentially leading a FOP trip and as a leader I think I could convey this excitement to others and get the freshmen excited even when we are getting up early and staying when tired to finish important camp tasks, like bear-bagging, before bed. </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My greatest challenge would be the technical work; I don’t have extensive backpacking or hiking experience so I don’t know very much about the protocol for setting up camp and other technical skills. As a group leader it would be extremely important for me to be a master of all the necessary skills, from setting up tents or tarps for sleeping to outdoor cooking. Little details like using the correct knots on ropes or how exactly to purify water will be very important to have mastered.  I know that FOP trains all leaders so to compensate for my lack of extensive previous knowledge of course I would work extra hard to learn and familiarize myself with all of the necessary procedures so that I could become very comfortable before leading a trip of freshman out into the wilderness. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[On August 18th of this past year I was all set to start climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro on the 20th with two friends. After an exciting briefing meeting with our guide, that night with uncanny timing I came down with the first case of food poisoning in my life…and proceeded to spend all night and the next day throwing up ten times. When my friends heard how sick I was, of course they were very concerned and offered to try to push back our climbing date. To do this, though, would also mean shortening the climb to five days instead of the recommended six if we wanted to make our flights- including a last torturous day descending all 19,341 feet in one nonstop day. I thought about how horrible I was feeling and my concerns about climbing without being able to keep any food down, and I was tempted to ask my friends to call our guide. Then I considered the complications that could arise from rushing our trip and how strenuous the last day would be for all of us. Ultimately I decided to stick with the original plan and hope for the best because it didn’t seem right to hinder my friends’ climbs. I had no idea at the time how difficult climbing would be with the food poisoning that lasted the first three days, but the trip was worthwhile and the extra day was definitely needed- I’d make the same call again despite my extra personal difficulties.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[First of all I would pull Peter aside as we cooked dinner to talk about a plan for the next day to go over my own concerns and see what he has picked up on with the FOPpers and his worries. I would talk to him about the connection gaps I have been sensing among certain FOPpers like Renee, Lizzie, and Matilda and Phillip and Daniel. I would want to get his views on how best to deal with them so everyone has the best experience possible. At the same time I would nicely mention to Peter that I feel like Phillip really looks up to him so his positive reinforcement of Phillip’s stories is just as important as the response Phillip receives from his fellow FOPpers. After this talk, Peter and I together could face other important issues among the FOPpers.
A huge and pressing concern for me would be Kelly shivering and “doing nice things” like giving away her desserts because she “gets full quickly”. Since I’ve already mentioned her shivering to her I wouldn’t want to put her on the spot again immediately if I could avoid it. As the sun goes down quickly when we get to camp I would instead start by having a casual group discussion over dinner about what a big day we have tomorrow and encouraging all of the FOPpers to eat a lot so they have strength for the next day. To lead by example I would also make sure Peter and I eat a lot to show how important and normal that is. At the same time I would talk generally about the importance of staying warm and comfortable especially because we had a thunderstorm earlier and I don’t want anyone to get sick for the opening days of class. If Kelly continues to shiver and not add more layers I would then pull her aside again privately and offer her extra layers of mine in case for some other reason she is missing hers or there is another problem. 
After dinner as we are all hanging out before bed Peter and I could talk to the FOPpers about how the trip is drawing to a close and we want to have a little reflection looking forward to the opening days of freshman year. We could see if we could find a cool spot with a view of the stars and all lay down to relax and stargaze, then start a discussion about looking forward to Harvard. Because I have noticed the disconnect with some FOPpers having more travel experience and others seeming to feel left out, I would bring up how everyone should remember that FOP is only one of the nearly infinite opportunities at Harvard; I would tell my FOPpers specifically how I had wanted to travel and Harvard funded that opportunity to make it possible for me and see what hopes they had for their own freshman years to hopefully find common ground in freshman excitement.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[- June 2013: 4 day backpacking trip on the appalachian trail with my sister. I had never been backpacking before, so I played the role of the learner and helper. However, I did help out getting food, planning the trip, cooking, and all sorts of things. As the trip went on I felt more and more comfortable on the trail. 

- Summers for my entire life: Day hikes while staying at my families cabin in Vermont. 

- Camping all my life: My family would occasionally go camping (mostly at campsites with our car available).

-FOP 2013: I went on fop!

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Floor Time (Therapy through play): I worked with an Autistic girl for all four years of High School. I would work with her by engaging her in play and trying to make her more comfortable with everyday interactions.

Ultimate Frisbee Camp Counsellor: I’ve taught at an Ultimate day camp for the last two summers. My responsibilities as a counselor were not only to teach kids Ultimate all day, but also make sure that the campers were having a positive camp experience.

High School Ultimate Captain (2012, 2013): I was a co-captain of my ultimate team during both my Junior and Senior years in high school. As the captain of the team, I had a lot of responsibility leading the entire program. I organized and ran workouts, practices, team activities, etc. Especially during my Senior year, I was incredibly invested in how good of a team we were--not only on the field, but also as a cohesive group of friends.

Circus Smirkus (“Buster”): When I traveled with Circus Smirkus (a New England youth traveling circus based in vermont), I was chosen as a Buster for my second year with the troupe. As a Buster, it was my responsibility to organize certain chores, set an example for others in the troupe, and help create a healthy group dynamic through the stressful environment of a traveling circus.

Mentorship (High School leadership program): During my junior year of high school I met once a week during the fall with a group of 7th and 8th grade boys. My co-leader and I strived to provide a safe environment for the kids so that they would feel comfortable not only with the daunting thought of highschool, but also to ask us any questions or concerns that they had. (e.g. drug awareness, work-load, social scene, sports, etc.)

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[While leading a group of first years, I think that I would be able to create and maintain strong relationships with individual FOPpers. I believe that one of my strengths is really trying to understand someone and relate to them. I think that I can find a good balance between being friendly and personable without figuratively stepping into someone’s personal space. Many people are afraid of becoming good friends with people that they consider a leader or teacher, but I think I could bridge the gap and make them comfortable getting to know me. In general I think that my personality is compatible with a lot of people, and I tend to connect with a lot of people that do completely different things than me as well as come from completely different backgrounds.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I believe that my biggest challenge as a leader of first year students would be balancing my silliness and my seriousness. During my FOP trip this last August as well as on many ultimate teams where I did not a have a huge leadership role, I tended to take on a silly composure. My silliness comes genuinely, and I find that it helps ease the atmosphere around not only myself, but the people around me. However, honestly I struggle to know when to turn the silliness off. One of my biggest fears in a role of leadership is not knowing or sensing a group tension and being silly in the wrong moment, which might result in further tension or hurt. However, I do know that I have a serious side. But sometimes, like captaining my ultimate team, I think that I became too serious which also may hurt the team or group dynamic. During my Senior year captaining my Ultimate team, I found myself over invested in the teams success and I think that I hurt the lightheartedness that needs to come with a group. My biggest challenge leading FOP would be balancing the two (silliness and seriousness). If I could successfully do that, I believe it would make me a better leader in any group situation, especially FOP. Both qualities are called for at certain times, but if I leaned too heavily on one or the other I might affect the group in a way that isn’t positive.

		<Q7.4><![CDATA[The most difficult decision that I’ve ever made came during November of my Junior year of High School. For the past two summers I had traveled with Circus Smirkus, a youth circus. While the summer was focused on creating and performing a show, the most important part of the experience was definitely the friends that I made. Over the two summers, I made some great friends and we had a wonderful community of not only kids, but also the adult directors, coaches, staff, and crew. All 30 youth performers lived together virtually all summer and made incredibly bonds through training and  performing together. My Junior year, however, I was faced with a new opportunity for summer. Instead of traveling with the circus again, I could try out for an ultimate frisbee team that would compete in the world championships in Dublin, Ireland the following summer. To have a chance to try out for the Ultimate team, however, I would have to give up my spot in the circus. This was by far the hardest decision that I’ve ever made. My decision making was largely based on my desire to have a new experience, but at the same time I felt as if I was turning my back on my circus family. In the end, I decided to try out for the ultimate team and not return to the circus. I am proud that while making this decision I talked with the directors of the show several times to talk through my decision making process. At the same time, I strongly regret not communicating better to my circus friends about how hard the decision process was for me, as well as not keeping them up to date enough during the process.

		<Q7.5><![CDATA[1. One of my main concerns while reading this scenario was the seeming discomfort of Renee. From the description, it seems that Renee got uncomfortable specifically because Lizzie and Matilda began talking about their luxurious back grounds. The two girls backgrounds, which include exotic trips that were probably very expensive, are probably much different from Renee’s. It seems that their discussion has made Renee uncomfortable, possibly because she did not have the same fortunate background as the two other girls. Clearly, the best thing that could happen in this specific example is to help Renee feel more comfortable. To do this a couple of things way have to be done. First, I might respond to this situation by checking in with Peter and opening a discussion that night about how everyones backgrounds in the groups are different, and respecting each other. I believe that it is really important to not call out Lizzie and Matilda because it could only create a tension between all the girls. I believe it would be good to privately check in with Renee, possibly remarking on her change in behavior and ask her if she’s okay and wants to talk about anything. Again, it’s important not to call her out and put her on the spot for her change in behavior.

2. Another concern is that it seems like Mark is pulling a lot of the weight for the rest of the FOPpers. It certainly seems that Mark is doing so voluntarily, but it’s not only unfair for one person to carry more than others, but it’s also possibly dangerous. I think that there is real importance in everyone working together to accomplish tasks both around the camp (setting up tarps, etc.), and on the trail (carrying their share of the weight). If everyone pulled their weight, then the group could more easily thrive. Again, it is best not to call anyone out during this situation, but instead bring it up as a group discussion. It would probably be good to talk about the responsibility of carrying one’s weight, especially with the emphasis of absolutely carrying your personal gear. I would first check in with Peter about the situation, and then possibly ask anyone that thinks they can’t carry their own share to pull me aside and talk to me about it. If someone seems like they’re struggling, (especially Kelly, because she could possibly be sick), then it would be best to make sure they have a lighter pack. Also, Mark really may like the challenge of carrying a heavy pack, which is fine. But I would maybe hint at the importance of accomplishing things as a group, rather than taking on too much of the load himself.

3. I would additionally be concerned by the unhealthy dynamic surrounding Phillip. First of all, it seems that Daniel is sucking up to Phillip quite a bit, with little to no avail. This is not good  because Phillip isn’t responding to Daniel and Daniel may be hurt as a result, but it also seems that Daniel is changing himself so that he will appear more “cool” to Phillip. This change might hurt Daniel’s relationship with other members of the group. Additionally, Daniels talking about “getting trashed” may make certain people in the group get uncomfortable. I think that it is important not to condone Daniels talk about partying at all, and probably best not to acknowledge it. If it’s a topic at all though, its probably best to address in a group conversation. Lots of people, whether they plan to drink in college or not, will be interested in how alcohol is used at Harvard. I think that I would pull Daniel aside if his stories on drinking got to be too much. I would tell him that that topic is simply not our focus as our group, and to talk about drinking less. Also, It is not a good situation that Phillip makes it public that he identifies as more mature than the rest of the FOPpers. I think that in this situation it is best to simply ignore him, and make sure not to puff up his ego, and thus bring down the rest of the group. If it gets too bad, it may be necesarry to check in with him about trying to make better friends with others in the group and be more inclusive. (Here I’d really have to be careful how I phrased it. The last thing I would want to do is offend him). Also, I would quickly check in with my co-leader Peter about Phillip. Phillip has been talking to Peter and me a lot. I would communicate to Peter that it’s best not to both encourage him or react badly to him by rolling his eyes. If a FOPper saw him reacting badly, it could make his role as a leader less effective. I would really make sure that I’m on the same page with Peter about the whole situation with Phillip.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[On the trail, I think that my cheerful personality, my ability to relate to people from different backgrounds, and my previous experience with outdoors leadership would be key to effectively leading a group of first-year students.  During Fuzzy Cheesecake at the end of FOP this year, a few of my group members mentioned my smile—I’m almost always smiling because I love people!  On the trail, my general good spirits would help to keep the group excited and be very helpful in fostering camaraderie.  After going to high school in the school district serving the most expensive area code in California, I lived on a tight budget over my gap year, living on a friend’s floor for a month. These different perspectives allow me to relate to people of different socioeconomic backgrounds, which would be crucial given the diversity of Harvard’s undergrads.  Finally, my experiences leading and teaching people would be great boons on the trail.  During my time whitewater rafting this past summer, I got a lot of experience working with a group of people to pool our abilities to stay safe and have fun.  My experience with river safety and teaching rafting skills should transfer to the trail to allow me to lead a group of FOPpers very well.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think that my greatest challenges in leading a group of first-year students would be my tendency to say what’s on my mind and my lack of physical fitness.  I tend to say what I think is true and can occasionally be tactless.  This can be useful when I’m calling someone on something they’re saying, but can be problematic around emotionally sensitive people.  Also, I sometimes don’t know when to stop talking.  On the trail, I’d be worried that this would lead me to talk too much and not spend enough time listening to the FOPpers, or that my extraversion could be intimidating.  In order to lead a trip effectively, I’d need to check myself to ensure a balance between being talkative and being reserved.  My lack of physical fitness is something that was particularly noticeable on FOP this year.  Although a B trip was fine as a participant, I’d be more confident that on an A or A/B trip I would have the energy to hike and also lead to my best ability.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I had a difficult time deciding what activities to join at the beginning of this year because there were simply too many things that I found interesting.  At the beginning of the semester, I was torn between singing and publication design, two activities I was involved in and loved in high school.  I was also considering doing archery or club Ultimate.  In the end, I decided to join Glee Club this semester and hold off on other commitments.  I knew that I’d gain the most from my limited time at Harvard if I got a good amount of sleep, which would be impossible if I was taking the difficult courses I was interested in and participating in more than a couple of the activities I wanted to try.  I eventually decided which activity to join because I recognized that without singing, I wouldn’t have a scheduled musical outlet to keep me sane and happy.  I’m definitely happy with my decision—I love Glee Club, and I know that my decision to limit my extracurricular commitments has had a positive impact on my academics.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	This situation has a lot of things that worry me, both in terms of the group dynamics and the wellbeing of the individual FOPpers.  However, I’d mostly focus on Mark, Kelly, and Peter because the text suggests that they’re most likely to cause themselves or others bodily harm.
	For me, Mark’s health is a serious concern because, although I don’t know that much about his general physical fitness, his carrying most of the gear is both inequitable and not good for him.  In the short term, I’m worried that Mark would end up injuring himself because of the added weight—having a more difficult day tomorrow means that it’s even more critical than normal that Mark be carrying a normal amount of weight.  I’d respond in a few different ways to ensure that it was effective while avoiding making him feel uncomfortable by singling him out.  First, I’d specifically set out different piles of group gear and give a “just take one” shpiel, then ask Mark whether he could carry the Cheerios (or some other voluminous light group gear) so that it would be physically impossible for him to carry too much weight.
	Kelly’s shivering is also worrying because if she’s cold during the day, then I’d be very worried about how she’s faring at night.  In the valley that we’re in, I’d expect that it could get much colder than the trail.  If Kelly is underprepared despite FOP’s clothing requirements, then she could end up being cold often or possibly having even more serious cold-related problems.  If Kelly wasn’t wearing all of her layers on the trail today, I’d ask her to wear an extra layer tomorrow to stay warm; if she was, then I’d see whether Peter or I had an extra layer to lend her.
	I’d say the single largest issue is Peter’s behavior today, which worries me mostly because it’s often going against our goals in communicating with the FOPpers.  Peter’s eye-rolling at Phillip doesn’t seem like an unreasonable response given Phillip’s attitude, but it’s the kind of thought that he, as leader, should keep inside.  More troublesome are his announcements before we got to camp: First, it’s much more likely that the FOPpers will go to the Gage Caves if they know about them than if they don’t know about them.  Second, a competition to put the tarps up the fastest seems completely counter to our goal of fostering community and teamwork within our FOP group.  I’d ask Peter to do more check-ins and consider doing some extra team-building games before we turn in.  I’d also definitely do all of our activities together and then stay up a little longer than the FOPpers to make sure that no one snuck off at night to go caving.]]></Q7.5>

I have not had much experience with the outdoors, but I have always loved exploring the woods outside my house and taking walks with my family, and I am excited to spend more time in the wilderness.  FOP was my first experience with camping and full-day hikes, and I absolutely loved it.  I’m excited to spend more time outdoors and get even more familiar with the terrain, wildlife, plants, and everything else that comes along with spending lots of time outdoors. ]]></Q6.1>

		<Q7.1>1</Q7.1>
		<Q7.2>One of strengths in leading a group of first-year students would be my patience and my ability to listen.  I always try and hear what people are saying and do my best to support them in the best way I can.  For example, when I lived on a junior girls dorm as a senior in high school, while I was not the most vocal leader, I always had my door open for the juniors to come in and talk about their problems, or their successes, or anything they wanted to tell me.  Whether they needed advice or help or just someone to listen to, I always did my best to reach out to them.  This would benefit me in leading a group of students because they would be able to talk with me about anything and know I am always there to support them.  This would also allow me to have a good sense of how the group is feeling throughout the trip so that I would be able to support the group in whatever ways are most needed.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[My greatest challenge in leading a group of first-year students would be that I tend to be fairly quiet, and I don’t always know exactly what to say in every situation.  Even though I am always very excited and supportive, I often have to work very hard to be outgoing and vocal.  This would make leading a group of students a challenge because when working with a group of people who have just met each other, it would be easier to get people excited and talking with each other if talking came easier to me.  This was one of my challenges as a leader on my swim team.  Even though I lead by example and supported my team, it was not always easy for me to step up and make my cheers heard across the pool.  In leading a group of students I would have to step outside of my comfort zone in order appear as outwardly welcoming and supportive as possible.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One difficult situation that I was faced with my senior year of high school took place one night on dorm with one of the juniors who I was good friends with.  She and her roommates had been disruptive during study hall, and didn’t finish their work.  I was making sure their lights were off later that night when they asked me if they could stay up for a few more hours to finish their work.  As their friend, I wanted to let them stay up, but as a senior I was responsible for making sure they got to bed on time.  I thought that an extra hour or two of work wouldn’t hurt them too much, but I decided to ask them to go to bed anyway.  I was tempted to let them stay up, but instead I tried to explain to them how sleep was just as important to me as finishing my work, and that was why we had study hall and lights out built into our schedules, to allow for both.  The conversation was slightly awkward, because they were expecting me to let them stay up, but I had gone through the same thing as an underclassman, and I wanted to show them that I valued using my time well so that I got enough sleep, and that I thought they should as well. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern in this scenario is how Peter feels about the group.  He has likely seen many of the same issues that are described here, but it is likely he has also noticed different interactions and has different thoughts about how the FOPpers are getting along as well.  The first thing I would do would be to talk to him about how the trip has been going, about any concerns that he has, and about what we should do to best prepare for the next day.  I would want to be on the same page with my co-leader before I misread a situation or did something that he didn’t agree with.

My second concern is with how the FOPpers are interacting with each other, and how well they are connecting as a group.  One thing to consider would be what to do about what was described with Philip and Daniel.  It seems as if Philip is separating himself from the group because he somehow sees himself as better than the others, and Daniel is trying to follow him in this way.  This worries me because it is likely that the other FOPpers have noticed this, and I do not want something like this to create tension in the group.  I would also want to see what Peter has to say specifically about this, especially considering how much time Philip had been spending with him, and the eye roll that I might have seen.  I think one thing that could help this situation, and benefit the rest of the group as well, would be to do an activity that reminds all of the FOPpers that they are all in the same boat as incoming Harvard freshman, even though they all came from different backgrounds.  If the FOPpers could recognize that they all have similar worries or excitements about starting school, it might be easier for them to less concerned about how they are different from one another, and focus more on getting to know each other and having fun.

Besides my concerns about how the FOPpers are getting along with each other, I am also concerned about the energy of the group.  Given the long day and unexpected rain, and the challenging hike tomorrow, I would want to make sure that every person in the group is feeling ready to take on the challenge in high spirits.  Even if every person is not close with everybody else, as long as everybody is ready and willing to take on the challenge of coming together as a group, even through the tough day ahead, then we have a much better chance of having a fun, successful trip.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think one of my greatest qualities in leading a group is staying calm in stressful situations. I’m not the type of person to freeze up and forget what to do. I’m very methodical and like to take control of the scene. I think personality wise, I am a good listener, and I feel like I am able to ask questions that help friends figure think about their problems in a different way or in a way that helps deepen a conversation. In addition to my more serious side, I like to be silly and have fun and sing music and dance horribly. Relationships with my friends and family are my top priority, so by committing to a week in the wilderness, I think I would be able to develop a really strong mentor-mentee relationship.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think one my greatest challenges in leading a group of first-year students would be in bringing such a large amount of positive energy to the group 24/7. Generally I am a pretty positive person, but when you are hiking for hours on end and making dinner, I think it would be difficult to motivate a group of freshmen who are unsure what they are doing at Harvard when you are also exhausted. I still remember freshman week after FOP and how tired I was from meeting people all day long. Another challenge would be to draw reserved freshmen out of their shell. I’m a little more introverted than extroverted so I could imagine that I might occasionally have to move outside my comfort zone to make shier FOPpers feel welcome. However, I would work with my co and be open about my weaknesses to help us hit all the emotional bases.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[When I was working in the Harvard Homeless Shelter, a male guest came up to me at 3 a.m. and made some inappropriate comments about several female staff members. He was also clearly frustrated with himself and with his current state of homelessness. During our conversation, the first time he made an inappropriate comment, I noted that I didn’t feel threatened, but in the case that the situation changed, I knew I could excuse myself to do something in the kitchen or move closer to where another volunteer was working. My second concern was addressing what he was saying. I noticed that although he did make references about young women occasionally, he was mostly frustrated and wanted someone to listen. I decided that it was best that he talk out his feelings rather than I confront a few inappropriate moments. That way he would not feel attacked and wouldn’t feel the need to respond inappropriately to me, especially since I was already alone. Also since this conversation was happening in the main public space where some of the guest stay, I didn’t want to disturb the peace or create an atmosphere that might feel unsafe for some other guests. Looking back on the situation, I would have reminded the guest that it was against shelter policy to make inappropriate comments about staff members and ask him to not do so in the future. I think asking in such a way would have prevented the situation from escalating.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern is that ever since Lizzie and Matilda began talking about their upbringing that Renee has stopped spending time with them. Moreover, it is very concerning that she is hiking behind the leader and not very receptive to questions. I would first try to switch up the order of the line by birthdays or by the letter of first names to see if she opened up more to others. This would also improve other cliques that had been forming. If switching up the line order didn’t improve the situation, I would be highly concerned that Renee felt so uncomfortable that she stopped talking because she might be judged for having less or having traveled less. In order to make Renee to feel more comfortable again, I would suggest that we do a bonding game such as everyone talks for three minutes about themselves. I would go first and try to be very honest so that others would feel comfortable lowering whatever protective barriers. I think if Lizzie and Matilda saw and respected how Renee grew up they might make a better effort to be more inclusive when choosing a topic subject. Hopefully Renee also takes the risk to open up about her feelings.
My second concern would be that Phillip is quite unresponsive to Daniel. I would want to address this issue because while it is good for two people to hit it off, it is not okay to exclude or ignore another in return. In order to get Phillip working with other people than Peter, I would engineer a situation in which Daniel and Phillip would have to work on a project together. For example, I would ask those two boys to work together and find a tree that would work to hang a bear bag and then to put up the necessary ropes. I would hope this fosters a new bond between them, but if not, I might try asking Peter to help bring Daniel into Phillip and his conversations 
My last concern would be that Mark is taking on too much responsibility. Although he is probably fine carrying so much weight, there is no need to risk a back injury from carrying all the heaviest items. In order to divide the weight more equally, I would divide the piles beforehand to make sure everyone was contributing. Also I would get more people involved in helping cook and be more specific in distributing jobs to others. This would be a good way to get the quieter FOPpers Kelly and Jack more involved and working with different people.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Having gotten through my first semester of college, I feel that I have a lot of compassion for what the incoming freshman will be going through on the trip and in the weeks that follow.  Transitions have always been difficult for me, and coming into college, I was incredibly nervous.  I want to be a FOP leader because I am sensitive to the anxieties that occur and I know that I have a lot to offer in terms of support and advice.  I am a very open and inclusive person and will do everything I can to create the non-judgmental, supportive, and unpressurized atmosphere on FOP that is such an important antidote to orientation week. 
I think I would be able to put people at ease that may be feeling nervous or uncomfortable in the group because I really love and value the special bonding that can occur in the backcountry and see FOP as an opportunity to connect to people who you would not ordinarily interact with.  FOP lets you make friendships because you care for each other and support each other, and I am very committed to fostering this environment.  These kinds of friendships, which many people had at home, usually are difficult to form during the first few weeks on campus when people are thinking a lot about their image. I am also good at staying upbeat and supportive even when it’s the end of a long day and everyone is tired. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>My biggest weakness in leading FOP would be accepting it if the people in my group are not able to connect over the course of the trip.  I would definitely do everything I could to make sure that people felt comfortable in the group and that they were being inclusive, but if the group just does not like each other, I might blame myself and be brought down by it.  It is part of my personality to want everyone to have a good time and to feel sad if people are not.  I would prepare myself for this before a trip though, and try to keep things in perspective.  Another challenge that I might have is following through with activities that are important that the incoming freshman do not want to do.  For instance, if I were delegating an unpleasant task, I would rather do it myself than have the FOPpers resent me.  Again, by putting the trip in perspective and reminding myself what I got out of my wonderful but imperfect trip, I could overcome this challenge.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[During junior year, it started to notice that one of my best friends was self–injuring.   She had a very dysfunctional relationship with her parents, and did not want them to get involved, so after I confronted her about it, she asked me not to tell anyone out of fear that the information would get back to her parents.  After over a month of talking to her about it every day, worrying every night, and feeling like I was incompetent and letting her down, I decided that I had to get an adult involved.  This decision started with the realization that the situation wasn’t fair to me- that I was also just a kid, and had my own schoolwork and family that I wasn’t able to fully engage with.  Quickly though, I realized that more importantly, I was doing wrong by her.   My friends and I weren’t going to be able to help her as much as professional help was, and the longer we waited, the more she sank into bad habits and damaging thought patterns.  Even though she was angry for weeks after we told the school counselor, she got better, and I knew that I had done the right thing.  In hindsight, I wish that I had told her earlier in our conversations about it that we were going to need to tell someone, so that she could have gotten used to the idea before the situation deteriorated.  ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My biggest worries would be Kelly’s health and wellbeing, the social exclusion that is occurring due to discussions that assume a certain socioeconomic status, and the general fragmentation of the social dynamic of the group, especially in between two difficult days.  I would be concerned about Kelly since it seems that her health might be in question; I have observed her shivering, giving away her food, and saying that she gets full quickly.  It is important that she eats enough since we are having challenging days that require a lot of fuel.  I would find an opportunity to talk to her alone just to check in to make sure that she likes the food so that if there is some food that we have that she likes more than others, I can make sure that she gets it.  I would also continue to remind the group how important it is to be well fed for a day of hiking. I would monitor her shivering for the rest of the trip and make sure that she always finishes the food I serve her.  To deal with the fact that certain topics of conversation are excluding members of the group, I would ask the group to begin the next day hiking next to someone they haven’t hiked next to yet and to talk about what they are excited about and nervous about.  This often helps find commonalities, and I found that doing this on my trip created a more cohesive group.  To address the general fragmentation of the group, I would have a sharing circle that night in which everyone talked for a few minutes and shared their “autobiography”.  This was one of the most memorable experiences of my FOP trip, and it really made me feel more connected with everyone in the group, and gave me an opportunity to let myself be supported.  As a leader, I would remind everyone to be respectful and to be a good listener during the exercise.  I would also share my own story and be honest and open and vulnerable as an example.  My very first step, however, would be having a private conversation with my co-leader to talk about the problems as I saw them, to get his thoughts, see if he had noticed any potential issues, and make a plan of action together, so that we were a unified and positive force in the group.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[Since last year, I have been a coordinator for PBHA’s Mission Hill After School Program and trained to be an outing club leader. Being a mission hill coordinator entails supervising and running a classroom of counselors and 9-11 year-olds, and I feel I have not only learned more about teaching, but also about group management. Running the classroom, and also devising the curriculum that we do with the kids each week, requires being sensitive to and aware of each student’s needs, as well as how best to manipulate the group dynamic to make each student’s experience in program the best it can be. Our kids did not get along very well as a group, and I learned a lot while working to bring out the best in every one of them despite the wide range of needs we had in the classroom. Running Mission Hill also involves balancing the kids’ needs with the counselors’ needs; our counselors are incredibly important to our program, and we have to also be aware of getting the counselors as engaged and involved as possible. 
	Training to be an Outing Club leader taught me a great deal of technical skills for wilderness leadership, as well as non-technical skills. On our training trip, we rotated who was leading, and the experience of actually being in charge of a group taught me a lot about balancing the many needs of a group in the outdoors. I also got to know myself as a leader, and became much more aware of my strengths and weaknesses.

		<Q7.2>Having a substantial amount of leadership experience, I am comfortable with leading and think that I would be able to balance the responsibility of leading a group in the outdoors with remaining present and engaged with my FOPpers and attentive to the emotional needs of the group. I have a lot of outdoor experience, and I am accustomed to dealing with whatever hardships nature has to offer with a clear head and good humor. I am enthusiastic about teaching, and love teaching others. I care deeply about people and would be attentive to every member of my trip, including my co-leader. Group dynamics are very important to me, and I think I have the awareness to create the kind of non-exclusive, accepting, and close-knit environment that I associate with FOP. I am an emotionally available, empathetic and open person, and think I would do a good job of creating a safe space for group bonding. Knowing myself as a leader, I am also aware of my weaknesses, and would be conscious of those while leading a group. I am a very positive person, and encourage those around me to be optimistic as well, especially when the going gets tough and some words of motivation are clearly needed. I can be an authority figure when necessary, but I am also a generally goofy person who is not afraid to laugh at myself.
</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[When co-leading with someone, I think that I can sometimes dominate and I would have to be aware of making sure I do not step on my co-leader’s toes. Generally manipulating social dynamics of the group to ensure all-inclusiveness without being obvious or awkward would also be a challenge for me. I think that I can have a tendency to get involved in and try to solve issues that are best left alone. As a FOP leader, I would have to not only be conscious of when I needed to respond to a social issues, but also how to do so tactfully and subtly. I sometimes struggle with directions and navigation, which could be a problem on a FOP trip when it comes to not getting lost. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[	After each day of program at Mission Hill (a low-income area in Boston), we walk the kids home. Last week on the second to last day of program, five girls ran away and hid in the bushes outside, and were then being disrespectful. A director reprimanded them by telling them they couldn’t come that weekend to final party, a large event where we present each kid with an award and the whole group gives a presentation. 
	With these girls especially it is important to follow through on disciplinary measures. We have not done this very well this semester, so I was concerned about having their respect in the future. It is a safety issue when the kids run away in the dark, and I wanted to make it clear that this was unacceptable so they would not put themselves in danger again. However, many of these girls do not have supportive or stable home lives, and I want to encourage them to be their best selves rather than being one more authority figure that only sees them as troublemakers. They had been otherwise good that day, and I was proud of their work for the final presentation. We decided to let them come to final party provided that their behavior on the last day of program was exemplary. They did come to final party, but I wish I had considered that disciplining them there would consequently be hard, ending the semester on a weak note.  
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[One of my primary concerns would be safety. This encompasses staying away from the Gage Caves, setting up tarps before dark, and having well-rested and healthy FOPpers for the next day’s challenging terrain. I would encourage the friendly competition between the two tarp groups, but would supervise to make sure that both tarps were up before sunset and that they had been set up well. I would also make everyone put on a layer when we took breaks so that Kelly wouldn’t feel like she was burdening the group, and then have frequent opportunities to layer/delayer. If I felt that it really was only Kelly who needed a layer, I would make the group stop for another reason (maybe a bathroom break) so she wouldn’t feel like she was burdening the group by needing to put on more layers. I would check and study the map the night before to be completely prepared to navigate the next day.
	I would also be concerned about every FOPper feeling valued and comfortable regardless of their background. As an end goal, I would want my FOPpers to be aware that others might come from backgrounds very different from their own, and each of their backgrounds offers a unique, valuable, and interesting perspective. This applies particularly to making sure that Renee, Kelly, and Jack all feel valued, comfortable and included, as well as monitoring conversations about alcohol. While hiking, I would do an activity we did on my trip, where the FOPpers pair off with someone they have not hiked with yet. At the next break for a meal, each person then shares with the group three interesting new things that they learned about their hiking partner. Two activities I would want to do at campsites with my FOPpers would be an activity where everyone anonymously writes down a concern about college that the group then talks about, and some kind of activity where people take turns sharing things about their lives. The first allows even the shy FOPpers to express their fears without putting them too much on the spot. The second hopefully not only encourages the shyer FOPpers to be comfortable sharing and to realize that they should be confident in who they are and where they come from, but raises awareness among other FOPpers, such as Lizzie and Matilda, about the many different and valuable perspectives on our trip.  
	Another concern would be generally making sure to check in with my co-leader about all of the above, and any other concerns he might have. I would not want to implement anything with the group without checking with him first to make sure we were on the same page.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think that I would possess various strengths leading a group of first-year students on FOP.  For starters, some of my attributes that would be helpful in leading a group are my enthusiasm, optimism, and motivational skills.  In most all endeavors that I make, I aim to maintain an enthusiastic and positive attitude and try to instill that positivity in those whom I work with.  For example, for all four years on my high school’s varsity Cross Country team, I enthusiastically participated in practice, consistently trying to get my teammates to share that enthusiasm, and eagerly cheered for teammates as they crossed the finish line after me.  It was this zeal that helped me become captain, and as a leader of the team, I motivated teammates with my words, actions, and positive attitude.  On my FOP trip this year, I displayed similar passion, always eager to keep hiking, reach the next peak, point out the surrounding beauty of nature, and revel in the feats that we just accomplished.  I would be motivating, in leading group, to point out how much has already been achieved and foster optimism about what lies ahead (whether that be on the trip or in college).  Additionally, since I have experience tutoring, another strength would be my ability to teach FOPpers on the trip (tying knots, setting up tarps, etc.).  Furthermore, I am a very social, outgoing person, and would enjoy getting to know my FOPpers, help them grow, and offer advice.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[One challenge that I would encounter in leading a group of first-year students is being responsible for a group of people around my age (or older).  I have babysat before and taken care of my younger brother and sister for a few weekends in the past, but being responsible (with one other leader) of 6-10 first-year students would be a bit of a challenge.  However, I think that my leadership experience in the past would help me to deal with this.  Another challenge I would encounter in leading a group of first-year students comes from one of my strengths discussed above: my enthusiasm.  Sometimes, I could become so eager and determined, that I may not notice a problem within the group or recognize the need to take a break.  I am a very resolute and competitive person, especially when it comes to physical activity, including hiking, so a challenge I would likely come across as a leader is putting the group’s well-being above my drive to accomplish the hike or take as few breaks as possible.  Nevertheless, thanks to my lifetime of family hikes and FOP trip this year, I am more able to accede to the necessity to take breaks and would try to prioritize the group, as I did as a leader on my cross-country team.  A third challenge for me could be dealing with students who maintain a negative attitude or avoid taking on group responsibilities, since I prefer working with people who in an honest effort.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One difficult decision that I made was choosing between taking CS50 and LS1a.  Both of these classes are in the subject area of science, which I wanted to continue learning about as an incoming freshman, and meet twice a week in the afternoon (I wanted as a few lecture times as possible and to avoid morning classes).  I ended up shopping LS1a but not CS50.  When it came time to make the final decision, I took various factors into account.  I thought about what it was that truly interested me, and what my potential concentration and career paths could be.  I realized that I do not plan on doing pre-med, so life sciences would not be extremely useful outside of that.  However, I thought back to how much I enjoyed freshman biology, sophomore chemistry, and junior year AP Chemistry in high school, and considered how much I would enjoy learning more in those subjects.  The prospect of learning some things I already knew before moving on to new material turned me off a bit.  I wanted to learn something completely new to me; I wanted to be a novice, a beginner.  This, in addition to praise for CS50 from a very close Junior friend of mine as well as the fact that CS50 can be applied to so many different fields (including my potential concentration of statistics), ultimately led me to enroll in CS50.  I wish I’d considered the factor of sleepless nights of coding, but don’t regret my decision.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[There are several concerns I would have as a FOP leader in this situation, my biggest three being exclusive relationships, group cohesiveness, and health/safety.  Although my first two concerns are related, they are distinct and very important to me as a leader.  One of the rules I learned as a FOPper was “No hop on FOP.”  At first, this rule was explained to mean no romance on FOP trips.  However, there is much more to this rule.  It denotes that exclusive relationships are not condoned on FOP trips, which are meant to foster group bonding and growth.  Part of my concern here is the friendship between Lizzie and Matilda.  The two of them are growing to be close friends, which is great (FOP should create lasting friendships that help first-years adjust to life at Harvard and allow them to come into the first week of college with a group that they can turn to), but it seems to me that their closeness may be making the rest of the group’s relationship a bit unstable.  It is this type of exclusive friendship (their behavior has caused Renee not only to avoid them, but to grow a bit averse to the group as a whole) that would worry me as a FOP leader; I don’t think that specific political views should be a topic of conversation for our FOP group.  Similarly, I worry about Suzy’s feelings for Mark, and wonder if she could be trying to create an exclusive relationship that further puts group togetherness at risk.  Likewise, there are similar situations between Daniel and Phillip and Phillip and Peter, where the former person in each case is trying to form a closer friendship with the latter, but the latter is somewhat opposed.
This set of concerns about exclusive relationships ties into my worries about our closeness as a group.  As a leader, I want my group to be as a close as my group was during my FOP trip.  In order for this to happen, it would be helpful if Jack and Kelly could buy into the idea of growing close as a group, as they appear to be excluding themselves a bit at this point.  Moreover, in order for us to trust one another and feel like one unit, the exclusivity discussed above needs to decrease.
As I sit here pondering tomorrow’s preparation, I think about how to get my FOPpers to come together.  I also worry about their health and safety.  Kelly is showing signs that she is sick (shivering, not eating much) and I think I will remind her, and the rest of the group, to continue to hydrate even more than usual, especially with our arduous five miles tomorrow.  I am also concerned by the thought of someone wandering over to the Gage Caves.  I have decided to set an order for the FOPpers tomorrow as we hike so that they talk with people whom they may not be too close with now.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[- I grew up in Colorado, so throughout middle and  high school I went on many hiking/camping trips with friends and/or family in the Rocky Mountains.
- I have climbed 11 of the 54 "14ers" (mountains taller than 14,000 ft) in Colorado with friends and/or my dad.  Only one-day events, so not much planning goes into them, although we do bring a map to look for different trails and make sure we are on track.  
- My friends and I go on a number of 1-2 night camping trips in the mountains every summer.  Together we set up the tent, make the fire, prepare the food, etc.  
- November, 2011: 6 day hiking/camping trip in Patagonia, Chile with one friend.  Together we planned the route, the packing list, and purchased the food.  We carried everything on our backs, and every night cooked dinner together on a camping stove.  
- I have been white water rafting two times.  Both times we have had an experienced guide.  
- I also ski a lot in the winters, both by myself and with friends/family!

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[This past summer I went to Beijing with HYSLC (Harvard Summit for Young Leaders in China), where I taught a two week seminar to Chinese high school Juniors and Seniors about Westward expansion in the United States.  The program was run similar to a summer camp outside of the seminars, so I was also in charge of a "house" that competed in different games and activities.  Several of the Chinese students then came to Harvard for a week, and one stayed in my room.  I showed her around Harvard and took her to different classes and meals.  Before college I took a gap year, during which I spent 5 months in Chile and 4 months in China.  In both places, along with other things, I was teaching Chilean and Chinese middle schoolers English.  At Harvard I have participated in Mission Hill, the after school tutoring/mentoring program, where I worked with several junior high students.  In high school I was vice president of our high school, which was very rewarding and gave me the opportunity to meet and get to know most of the students in our high school.]]></Q6.2>

		<Q7.2>I think one of my greatest strengths would be creating a comfortable atmosphere and keeping everyone positive and pumped up about the trip.  I am a very upbeat, positive person and rarely get down or become short with people in difficult and tiring situations.  When I am challenged or tired or stressed, I often instead become goofy and motivated.    I also really enjoy getting to know people and am genuinely interested in where they are from, what the enjoy doing, etc.!  I am also involved in several different clubs and groups on campus, so I think I would be comfortable answering questions about different groups or organizations or events on campus that first year students may have.  Also when I really enjoy a place that I am at, like Harvard, I really enjoy introducing new people to it and making sure that they are comfortable and enjoying it as much as I am, so after FOP I would make an effort to be available for my foppers to reach out to for questions or advice.   I also really, really enjoy exploring and hiking around the mountains and would love to be able to share in this activity with new friends and peers.   Finally, I like working with people more than I like telling people what to do, which I think would help the students feel more comfortable and more like they are a part of a team.   </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think something that could be difficult as a leader of a FOP trip is   dealing with the complaints and negative energy that might come out of the foppers a few days into the trip.   I know above I said one of my strengths is my positivity, but a person’s negativity is contagious and while it may not directly affect me, it certainly could spread to others in the group, which would be terrible for the trip.   So keeping downers from complaining and also keeping the negative thoughts from getting to the others in the group would be a challenge for me.  
Also perhaps my small size could be a weakness if ever we as leaders had to hoist or lift a person or any sort of equipment!
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>This past summer my cousin came to visit in Colorado, and we had made a list of things we were going to do, including climb two adjacent peaks in the Rocky Mountains.  In the Rocky Mountains it is strongly advised to be off of the mountain and in your car early afternoon, around 2-3 pm, for that is about the time when the thunderstorms roll in and you do not want to be 14,000 feet high in a thunderstorm! To make sure we were off the mountain on time we had planned to leave my house in Denver around 7 am.  After we had hiked the first peak which had taken longer than expected, however, we saw some storm clouds rolling in in the distance! My cousin was unfamiliar with Colorado weather and hiking, so it was up to me to decide whether we should take the chance that the clouds will blow over and finish our hike that we had been planning for weeks and were so excited about, or should we play it safe and descend to the car and drive back to Denver only having climbed to one of the summits.  I was very hesitant to make the decision that we descend, for my cousin had no plans to return to Denver anytime soon and this is something that had been on her bucket list and that she was so excited about, but ultimately I decided there is no point in risking our safety, even if the chances of a storm were slim, so I decided we should descend.  </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[
First in this scenario there seems to be a planning problem.  It seems that my co leader has been carelessly reading the maps and leading the group, which has resulted in the group being caught in dangerous weather and without daylight, which is incredibly dangerous and absolutely avoidable.   I think every morning the leaders should very carefully discuss the route for the day, and along the way continuously check that the group is still on track.  It can be very dangerous if the group were to ever get seriously lost, and that is something the leaders have complete control over and therefore the responsibility for making sure the group has a route, follows that route, and is able to make it to camp before dark on that route.  As a leader, the safety of our foppers would by my priority, and I never want to put them in danger by making the silly mistake of making a wrong turn.  At home when I hike, I am very paranoid about staying on track and not getting lost, and I’m sure I would be no less paranoid when leading a group of students all under my care and responsibility.  

A second mistake I noticed was the lack of attention given to Kelly after the leaders saw that she was shivering.  I think it is easy for the foppers to ignore pains or problems they are having, for they do not want to appear weak to the group nor hold the group back.  Because of this, I think it is very important if a leader notices even the smallest sign of discomfort or pain to pull the fopper aside and ask sincerely in private if everything is okay.  Along with safety, the health of the foppers should be another priority of the leaders.   There would be nothing worse than a freshman entering his/her freshman year with a serious illness from FOP that could potentially have been avoided.  

Finally, a third problem I notice is that some of the foppers could benefit from talking a little more and some could benefit from listening a little more.  It also seems that there are smaller groups forming within the larger group that are preventing conversation.   I think a way to facilitate conversation across a larger group of the foppers could be trail games and campsite games that are fun and through which we are able to learn about each other.  I love trail and campsite games! I know of lots that could be used on a FOP trip.   I think sometimes it is hard for people to talk about themselves in a new environment with new people unless presented with an opportunity in which they are explicitly asked to share a little about themselves, and I think this would be great for the whole group in this scenario. One of my favorite activities we did on my fop trip was around camp one night we had everyone go around and share a short bio of themselves.  It was so awesome! Many of the foppers had such interesting backgrounds and stories that they probably otherwise would never have shared

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[2007-2012: Boy Scouts of America campouts. I joined in 7th grade, and for the next 5 years I went on monthly campouts, week-long summer camps, and overnight outings, usually at state or national parks. A total of around 60 nights of camping; each campout usually entailed a hike and skills or leadership workshops.  
During this time, from 8th grade onwards, I took leadership roles--first as a patrol leader and then for a year and a half as a Senior Patrol Leader, guiding the whole troop and coordinating campouts from menus to hike routes, chore delegation to first aid instruction. 

June 2009: Canoeing Trip in Minnesota and Quetico Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada.  9 senior Boy Scouts and 3 adult leaders. We canoed, camped and portaged our way through the Boundary Waters and around a ten-day loop in Canada. My role was second-in-command among the Scouts, helping plan meals, camp duties and our route. 

March 2010: Family vacation to Great Smokey Mountains National Park. We hiked, climbed and biked every day for a week. I was a passionate participant! (good phrase, guys)

Fall and Spring 2012: Family hikes in Shenandoah National Park. Really gorgeous place for scenic hikes; my role was once again that of a passionate participant. 

June 1994-2012 (although most of the experience is 2007 onward): family vacations in Glen Arbor, MI. Yearly two-week family reunion right next to the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, where we went hiking, sailing, swimming and biking. 

August 2012:  FOP! A Switch trip led by Henney Sullivan and Emily Savage in the Bigelow Mountains and on Flagstaff Lake. My role was that of a very excited and satisfied FOPper.

Weekends in Summer 2013: Hiking. While I was in Germany studying abroad, some students and I went on day-trips hiking in the Alps, to Neuschwannstein Castle and Berchtesgaden.  I helped plan these outings, and I usually led the hikes. While I was in Russia on a bellringing tour with the Bell Society, we hiked across Valaam Island in Lake Ladoga, which was gorgeous.

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[I'm a volunteer student coordinator for the nonprofit service group EV Tutoring, (evkids.org) and I tutor with them as well. The group matches Harvard, BC and Tufts students with inner city Boston kids for one-on-one mentoring and tutoring once a week. As one of the coordinators I organize one of the three tutoring days each week, dealing with a group of about 15 tutor-tutee pairs, as well as planning long-term for recruitment, semesterly Tutor-Tutee activity days, and social events. My work for EV involves a lot of interpersonal work from sizeable groups to one-on-one interaction with my tutee Lascelle and with other tutor/tutee pairs. I have been tutoring in the group since last fall and a coordinator since the spring. 

I'm one of two Associate Editors-elect for the US Section of the Harvard Political Review (harvardpolitics.com).  Although I have just started, I've already begun working with writers to develop articles, and the other editors on the masthead to set long-term policy for the magazine. My experience so far has been valuable; I've advocated for articles and goals at large meetings and have started partnering with writers individually to tactfully work on their ideas. My editing experience dates back to my high school newspaper, where I served as the Opinions/Editorials editor. 

I’m the Vice President of the Lowell House Russian Bellringing Society (come on Sundays, the tower is open 1-1:30!), and have been since last spring. As part of this leadership role I run our comp and teach new members as well as guests who come each week how to ring. 

Chronologically my leadership in Boy Scouts comes first; I served as a patrol leader as well as Senior Patrol Leader; the duties of both of these involved leading hikes, teaching outdoor skills, and supporting younger Scouts.

I was a senior captain on my high school football team; practices, team activities and especially games gave me leadership experience. 

Note: I describe my Harvard leadership opportunities a little more in question 3.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[I believe I’m much better qualified to lead FOP this year; most of my new experience comes from the other extracurriculars I joined as a freshman. I was able to reach leadership positions, giving me valuable teaching and decision-making experience I didn’t have last year.

 Through my time as a coordinator for EV Tutoring, I've gained experience teaching and managing small groups of tutees as well as working with the other coordinators to make long-term plans for the program. My extra year of experience simply tutoring has undoubtedly helped as well; I've continued to teach and mentor Lascelle, my tutee, in one-on-one supportive circumstances, circumstances like those that could arise when teaching FOPpers skills or giving support. 

As Vice President of the Bell Society, I've taught new bell society members and weekly guests how to peal, stomp and trill bells in the Russian Orthodox style, which is much harder than it may sound. 

I've just started as an incoming Associate Editor for the Political Review, but I've taken any opportunity that's come my way to work with writers on their articles, which has let me practice the supportive yet when necessary authoritative teaching style so essential on FOP.

FInally, over the summer I had an 8-week study abroad experience in Germany and a bellringing tour of Russia. I taught an impromptu German review class before tests in Munich, and I went hiking over weekends in the Bavarian Alps and on Russia's Valaam Island (where my identification picture was taken), a far-northerly island in Europe's biggest lake and the home of a reclusive colony of monks, reaffirming my love for the outdoors all the while.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[When we were looking to plan weekend outings in Munich this summer, the group looked to me to take the lead. I’m responsible and reasonable, and generally trusted by my peers to get them up bright, early and excited to hop on a train to the Alps, figuratively speaking of course. 

I get along with people very well; one of my biggest strengths is bringing different people together.  Last year I helped build the freshman HPR comp class into a cohesive “Freshman Caucus” that’s still going strong today. This summer, I helped gel the group of German students with very diverse interests and backgrounds together by the end of the trip. Likewise, there are rough days and setbacks in tutoring, but I’ve kept gently encouraging Lascelle and built a strong, steady relationship we both love.   
I pride myself in good communication and teaching: being able to see what’s making something difficult for an HPR writer or a tutee, and clarifying in a way they’ll understand.  
Another strength is adaptability, and a sense for the needs of different situations. A different type of leader is required to motivate, to settle conflict, to deal with a first aid crisis, and I pride myself on seeing and filling the right role.
I’m passionate about the outdoors, and I think that shows when I’m singing on the trail or waking up early for another day of canoeing. And in other FOP-related skills, I’m very ready and excited to answer questions about the Harvard experience.

		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I’ll be the first to admit that I have a tough time making decisions quickly. I’m cool under pressure, and it will be nice to have a co-leader with whom I can discuss things, but I still need to work on taking the initiative.  

I’m very prepared to cooperate and reasonably compromise on issues, but when I am thoroughly convinced, I tend to be stubborn.  I have experience cooperatively leading, though, and I would never seriously disagree with my co-leader in front of FOPpers. 

In disagreements I’m not a part of directly, I try to seek a solution that makes everyone happy, which can definitely backfire. 
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I’d always wanted to study abroad, but when I was faced with the prospect of actually spending almost the entire summer in Europe around this time last year, I had to think long and hard about whether or not to go.  On one side was the natural thrill of travel, new experiences, culture, of learning language and history in their actual contexts.

It wasn’t that simple, however.  My alternative was a summer interning in Washington DC, near where I live in northern Virginia. The District is very different from Bavaria, but I knew my experience could be just as valuable in different ways. Additionally, I’d be able to live at home and spend time with my family, rather than having only a few weeks with them before heading back to school in the fall. 

When making the decision, I exhausted many classic tactics: making a pro/con list, discussing with friends, even flipping a coin, all to little avail. I knew what was at stake on both sides, and rehashing the arguments wasn’t helping. I had to deal with light pressure from my parents—my mom encouraging me to study abroad, while my dad had been pointing out internship programs downtown for a while. 

I went to Munich. I thought I’d rather learn about my true interests than my career aspirations, deciding that the former should come before the latter.  I’m so glad I did—I’m now searching for activities for this summer, and I know much more clearly where to look. 
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[The biggest concern here, before I start looking at interpersonal dynamics, is the health and safety of the FOPpers, especially with a long day today and a tough day tomorrow. After a long day, and especially with the sun quickly setting, Kelly needs to eat more than she has been. Giving up dessert is a nice bonding gesture, but if someone’s shivering during the day, they’ll be dangerously cold and fatigued at night. I’ll encourage her to eat all her dinner, letting her know that that’s the way to stay warm.  Similarly, with rough terrain coming up, pack loads need to be more evenly distributed. Mark has been great to help out so far, and I’ll tell him that, but I’ll make sure before we pack up in the morning that others, perhaps Phillip before Kelly but really everyone, is responsible for a more equal share.

Another big concern is the tendency of the group to split into smaller more exclusionary groups. I like to think I wouldn’t have let this happen in the first three days, using ideas like hiking in different orders and paying individual attention to FOPpers so that I could help bring together their interests. Exclusion, whether intentional like Phillip’s toward Daniel or unintentional like Lizzy and Matilda’s toward Renee, should never happen on FOP. I’ll talk to Peter about engaging with Daniel in front of Phillip, turning Phillip’s regard for Peter toward his fellow FOPper. I wouldn’t be surprised if Phillip and Daniel had more to talk about than Phillip seems to think, and Peter should be able to help them realize this.   I might split up Lizzy and Matilda next time we hike, and analogously I’ll try to connect with Renee or help foster friendship between her and other members of the group. A good FOP trip ends with FOPpers feeling a sense of connection between themselves, even (I’d say especially) when they have different backgrounds and interests. I’d discuss this with Peter as we cook, but maybe a sharing activity over dinner could help rebuild a more group-oriented ethos.

Finally, the situation between Suzy and Mark deserves attention. Even if they adhered to the no-HOP-on-FOP rule, a quasi-romantic relationship between FOPpers is not good at all for group spirit or inclusion. These two should probably not be paired together as frequently for activities or hiking, and I’d discuss with Peter how we’d keep an eye on them and, if necessary, make sure nothing happened by talking to them directly.

		<Q7.2>I found the most rewarding part of my experience on FOP to be the emphasis placed upon establishing meaningful relationships and reflecting on what I value in life and in interactions with others. I think that my strengths as a leader would lie in my desire to convey the importance of these pursuits, and I hope that my willingness to speak openly would encourage others to present themselves genuinely. I make an effort to remain optimistic and enthusiastic under difficult conditions, which I hope would encourage FOPers to embrace the challenges of being outdoors and to make the best of any situation. I am also able to remain organized and to pay attention to the details of a situation.   </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>The greatest challenge for me would be making sure that each member feels that they are a contributing to and accepted by the group. I am on the quieter side so I know that it can be difficult for some individuals to initiate conversations, and I would be concerned with helping these individuals make connections. I also think that being responsible for such a large group of people can be overwhelming and that it would be a challenge to focus on both the logistical and emotional aspects of the trip. </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[After playing high school soccer for three years, I decided to join the country team during my senior fall. In making this decision, I considered whether it would be worthwhile to try something new after having invested so much effort in improving my soccer skills over the past twelve years. I questioned which team I would be able to make the greatest contribution to and determined that, although I could work hard alongside my teammates at practice, I likely would not receive much playing time at soccer games, whereas I had the chance to contribute points at each cross country race. Cross-country also offered me the opportunity for greater personal growth, as I could prepare for the indoor track season and could observe my individual improvement over the course of the season. The most important factor in my decision was comparing the team environments. I felt that there was a sometimes harmfully competitive atmosphere on the soccer team where teammates resented each other for individual achievements. I often found myself unable to identify with many of the players who seemed more focused on partying than playing. The cross-country team, meanwhile, provided an inclusive atmosphere where teammates celebrated each other’s personal success. I felt that I could be a role model for younger athletes through my work ethic and discipline, and I was excited to have motivated teammates who would push me to improve. I therefore determined that cross-country would be a more rewarding and worthwhile endeavor.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[
Renee appears to be apprehensive about discussing her background, as it is likely that she has not had access to the same types of opportunities that Matilda and Lizzie have had. She may feel that the others will not understand her upbringing and may be apprehensive about joining a college community where many students come from privileged backgrounds. It is important that Renee and all of the FOPers realize that everyone has unique knowledge and experiences to contribute. In order to reinforce the validity of a variety of perspectives, I would initiate a group activity where each member discusses his or her life experiences so that the FOPers are sensitive to the fact that not everyone sees the world the way that they do. I would also be open in sharing my own background to make Renee and the other FOPers realize that everyone is unsure about whether they are prepared to enter into a new environment. 
Although it is great that Mark is so willing to help those around him, it is important that every member contributes to group tasks and that one person’s generosity is not taken advantage of. The cohesiveness of the group depends upon each person claiming responsibility for his or her role on the trip. I would reemphasize to all of the FOPers before they distribute gear that each member should bear an equal burden. It also seems that Suzy is focused on superficially catching the attention of Mark rather than attempting to have meaningful conversations with the members of the group. Pursuing romantic relationships is not appropriate during FOP because it detracts from the opportunity to get to know people that you otherwise might not spend time with. I would mention to the group as a whole that FOP is a rare opportunity to interact with others without the pressure of maintaining appearances and suggest that each member attempt to walk next to a different FOPer after each break.
Kelly and Jack appear to be uncomfortable initiating conversations and probably are feeling overwhelmed because they are facing so many new people and situations in such a short period of time. It is important that FOP helps new students in the transition to a new home and a new lifestyle, so I would want to make the trip as positive as possible so that each member feels confident in their ability to make a new start. In order to do this, I would try to initiate conversations between Kelly, Jack and the other FOPers, giving them a chance to easily contribute. It is also concerning that Kelly appears to be cold and not eating as much as the other campers, as hypothermia is a possibility and it is important that she have enough energy to complete each day. I would suggest that she wear more layers and would make sure that she is eating at each break. I would also ask her if she is comfortable with the pace we are walking at and would adjust the number of breaks if it seems necessary.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and the ability to listen are strengths of mine that would be especially important when leading a FOP trip of first-years. With emotional intelligence, one understands the best ways to motivate, relate to, and interact with others. FOP leaders must take the time to understand how their FOPpers react in certain situations and in what kinds of environments they thrive. As students make the change from their life at home to college, FOP leaders need to be careful to consider the emotional challenges, in addition to the (wilderness-induced) physical challenges, that first-year students may be facing during the trip. FOP leaders need the level-headedness and self-awareness to see that there are different ways to tackle a problem in the wilderness and be open to the suggestions of other people. My experience as a peer counselor on campus has helped me to improve upon and utilize these skills. Each year, we go through 50 hours of training to make sure that we are equipped to calmly deal with any kind of issue that undergraduates may be facing.
I feel very comfortable guiding first year students through these emotional changes and physical challenges that FOPpers may face as they start their transition to life at Harvard in the wilderness.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>The most difficult challenge I would face leading a group of first-year students would be dealing with defiant students who do not want to listen. This is a true test of patience for me. In addition, the lack of respect from the student makes it more difficult to deal with in a calm, thoughtful way. I would be certain to talk to my co-leader about this issue to get a different perspective on the same problem. How I deal with this may determine how other FOPpers view me as a superior and leader. If I react harshly or brashly, I may lose the respect and trust of other FOPpers since I was unable to deal with the situation without losing my cool. However, if I have taken the time to understand each of the first-year students in my FOP group, I will know the best course of action to take to resolve the issue for this specific individual. By considering the issue in this light, the FOPper would be most receptive to my course of action. Perhaps it would require me to take this student aside and talk with them about their experience so far. I would reinforce the idea that I am here to help them. I would make sure the FOPper knows that while I am a FOP leader, we are friends, and this experience is about being on the same team.  </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>Two summers ago while lifeguarding, a cloud of bees came over the pool. A small child had poked his head into a bush and woken a nest; chaos loomed. In under a minute bees had actually covered the sky. I had never seen so many bees, nor had I ever been trained to deal with swarms of insects before, but I knew I had to act quickly, decisively, and intelligently. I immediately blew my whistle and drew the attention of the panicking pool-goers. I did not yet know if the bees would attack or if they would just continue to sit over the pool. I had to buy time to observe without letting others get stung.  I calmly yelled for them to get into the pool. I had to breathe deeply and focus. I looked at cloud of bees and then intently at the individual bees. I saw that they were actually flying into people, chairs, and trees, but thankfully not stinging anyone. I could not have recognized this if I had not calmed myself down enough to spot the bees individually instead of looking only the impending cloud. I blew my whistle again and motioned for the pool-goers to exit the pool from the opposite side, away from the bees. I then lead the group out the back gate into safety.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Renee’s falling out with Matilda and Lizzie is concerning to me because it is her first interaction with students at Harvard. If Renee’s first interaction with other first-year students ends because of her inability to relate to them, she is entering Harvard discouraged and with misplaced preconceived notions. As a FOP leader, it is my job to make sure that Renee does find common ground with other Harvard students and to show that there is no one “cookie-cutter” Harvard student. A prematurely developed feeling of isolation could snowball easily and carry over to her first semester at Harvard. As the group leader, I would push to find commonalities between other FOPpers and Renee, encourage group discussion, and try to prevent the group from developing well-defined cliques, instead promoting unity and a family feel in our FOP group.

The second concern of mine is of Kelly. While I don’t have an issue with Kelly’s quiet nature, I, as a FOP leader, am responsible for Kelly’s health and safety. This means that I need to address the issue of Kelly shivering. It could be that it is only small bouts of chills from the cool weather, but it could also be that she does not have the proper equipment to be hiking in the wilderness. In either case, there was no harm in trying to fix the problem. I would approach the issue with caution. I would make a strong effort to get to know her and form a trusting friendship. Ideally, Jack would also open up, and the two of them would feel more comfortable with the rest of our FOP group I would not let an issue like this go uncared for.

The final issue I have is with Daniel. He has a skewed perception about college. He is already talking about getting wasted, which I think is not appropriate for a FOP trip. I don’t think the topic should be off-limits, but I do think it is necessary to talk about college life in a context and in a way that is beneficial to creating a healthy social life. I would not be okay with FOPpers trying to impress their peers by talking about their drinking escapades. It is more important to give a balanced perspective of college, since your perspective as a FOP leader is one of the first that these first-year students get as they arrive at Harvard.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[Besides my freshman year experience with FOP, I’ve had very littler backpacking or camping experience. What makes me want to explore the outdoors is to rekindle that closeness with Nature that I felt so strikingly on my own FOP trip in Vermont. I remember one night my FOPmates and I lay down on a sandy beach and stared up at the night sky. Never before had I seen such a night sky, a sky so clear and natural that I felt like I could see a hundreds of shimmering stars. We were breathless. Over a year later, this feeling of breathless wonder makes me want to relive this experience.]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[I love teaching and working with others. In high school I worked one-on-one with a young man who, because of certain circumstances, could not finish high school and was trying to pass the GED. As editor-in-chief of my school newspaper, I worked closely with students to improve their writing. As captain of my high school crew team, I helped mentor and encourage younger rowers. This year, I led a Men’s Family Group Bible Study in which a group of upperclassmen guys from the Asian American Fellowship met once a week throughout the semester to share in a time of accountability, personal introspection, and Bible study. This year I also joined CityStep, a program in which I teach dance to 5th graders at the King’s School in Cambridge. Though I’ve never learned, let alone taught, dance before in my life, interacting with these sprightly, energetic 5th graders has taught me how to be patient and understanding. The bulk of my formal teaching experience, however, started this past summer.

This past summer from the months of June to July, I spent 6 weeks teaching SAT English in Taipei, Taiwan to Taiwanese high school students. The experience was like no other. I had never had any formal teaching experience in a class setting, but from the very start my experience teaching in Taiwan transformed me through and through. Though an only child, I felt like my students were the younger brothers and sisters that I never had but always wanted. It was a challenge to teach as dry a subject as the SAT to a group of high school teenagers, to make the material more gripping and relevant than it might seem. Before I first set foot in my classroom, I made the conscientious effort to change my perspective towards my job as a teacher. Min-Woo, I thought to myself, you aren’t just their teacher. You’re their friend, their older brother, their mentor. And with that shift in perspective I set out to do my utmost to get to know my kids, not just as walking dictionaries, but more so as thinking, feeling, aspiring young adults. It was an absolute blessing to work, laugh, talk, and sympathize with them. I made it clear that in my classroom, I was not in any way better than they were, that my age or situation in life was a result of opportunities granted and mistakes made, and that they too could not only survive high school and pass the SAT, but, more importantly, do their best and become of themselves whatever they so dreamed of. I directly taught two classes, 17 students in total, but I also managed a daily study hall in which I interacted with students from the other classes. I remember one student in particular who was, for the first two weeks, on the shier, quieter side. His name was Benjamin. At first it felt as if I wasn’t getting through his stoic personality. Two weeks later after ceaselessly attempting to bolster his confidence and to encourage him both in the classroom and in study hall, I saw Benjamin smiling, laughing, and making jokes as much as the rest of my students. I had one resounding mantra in my classroom: “I care about you.” I’d say this everyday, for every class, until one day my students began rolling their eyes at my incessant reminder. And yet they still smiled whenever they saw me write, “I care about you” on the board or whenever they heard me say the phrase. My students—my kids—understood that I meant what I said.

After teaching in Taiwan, I spent the last two weeks of this summer as a Seminar Leader in Beijing at the Harvard Summit for Young Leaders in China (HSYLC). I taught 4 classes and over 50 high school students the “Art of Storytelling.” Inspired by my experience in Taiwan, my goal for HSYLC was to imbue these students with confidence and encouragement. Because my class placed special emphasis on the oral aspect of storytelling, it was inherently designed to be a seminar for open discussion, communication, and sharing. Active class participation was an integral part as students listened to their peers’ stories and delivered their own. I continually reemphasized over the course of the seminar that my class was a safe space in which no question or remark was ever “too stupid” for further examination. In both my classes and the additional office hours that I held before and after class, I did my best to learn from my students as much as I taught them. I learned that if I tried to cultivate two-sided relationships with my students in which I expected affirmation for myself in return for my encouragement, then I would never make my classroom a truly safe space where love is given, but not expected. By opening up first about myself and my personal struggle and inhibitions, I allowed my own students to feel comfortable to do the same. On the last day of class, I asked my students to grab their chairs and circle up. Though I had originally planned on discussing fairytales, I decided to spend the last day of class talking about our families. After talking to my students individually both inside the classroom and out, I had the notion that we might learn something valuable by simply sharing our family stories. I began the talk by confessing that though I loved my parents, I often did a poor job freshman year of college communicating with them, sometimes neglecting to answer texts for a few days at a time. I admitted that for as much love as I showed my students in the past two weeks, I was guilty of not explicitly showing my parents how much I cared for them on a daily basis. I told my students how I decided to make more of an effort to keep in constant contact with my parents come sophomore year. The students then went around in circle and, if they wanted to, talked about their relationships with parents and family. Tears streamed down some of their faces as they talked about the mothers and fathers and grandmothers who raised them. I had not expected such intimate, vulnerable responses, but I felt more than grateful to have the opportunity to help air out the familial issues and concerns that my students carried but never spoke of.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[One of my FOP-conducive strengths is that I look for the best in people. This, however, is a strength I haven’t always had. Especially in high school and even my freshman year of college, I definitely lacked the ability to save judgment. This summer taught me that relationships are the most valuable asset I can ever hope to develop, and that investing in people, no matter how different they might be from you, is a worthwhile endeavor for both parties. I’m not afraid to reach out to others when they seem down or alone, yet I understand the subtle difference between imposing myself on others and encouraging them. I am a firm believer that words of encouragement and praise, however small, go a long way in building confidence and community. I think that my greatest strength in leading FOP is my positivity. My dad is the owner of a Hawaiian restaurant and for the longest time has ingrained me with the idea that being positive attracts customers and friends. And from experience I understand that being optimistic is oftentimes the best means of forming lasting friendships. I sincerely love making people feel happy, and because I’ve received so much love from older sister/brother-like figures here at Harvard, I’m excited to give back that love to incoming freshmen.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>My greatest potential challenge would be navigating the outdoors. One major reason why I did not apply last year to be a FOP leader was that I had no prior experience camping or hiking besides my own FOP trip. I was under the misconception that most, if not all, FOP leaders were skilled outdoorsmen and outdoorswomen. Though I am confidant in my ability to make first-years feel at home, welcomed, and loved, I have never tried leading people through the woods on a camping excursion. But because I am so eager to usher in new freshman and to help foster community, I am also eager to learn how to lead a successful FOP trip, both in regards to social atmosphere and logistical thinking.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[The hardest decision of my life was deciding not to row sophomore year of college. I started rowing sophomore year of high school and went from being one of the worst rowers on my team’s Novice B boat to captaining the Lightweight Eight that won silver at the 2012 US Rowing Youth National Championships. Rowing taught me the essence of true camaraderie. I no longer worked for my own benefit but rather for the success of the seven other teammates on my boat. In fact, crew became such a consuming passion that I skipped my own high school graduation ceremony so that I could attend Nationals. Coming to Harvard, I felt blessed to have the opportunity to row at the most storied of collegiate rowing programs. Yet halfway through the year I realized that something was amiss. Though I was even more committed than before, and though I was competing on the first freshman boat, crew no longer gave me that same sense of satisfaction I had so earnestly expected. Because I rowed lightweight, I also struggled to cut weight. Crew became my single most burdensome source of stress, and so after much deliberation I decided to stop. Though I often miss the sport, sophomore year has been so much more rewarding because I feel so much happier than before. Having more flexibility in my schedule has allowed me to radically expand my social circles and to refocus myself on what’s important in life: relationships with people I care for.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first point of concern is making sure Renee doesn’t feel like an outsider. I suspect that her reaction to the childhoods of the other two FOPers Lizzie and Matilda is a direct result of her not being able to partake in such luxurious family vacations. Her terse replies might signify that she feels uncomfortable and estranged for having been brought up differently. I don’t know her exact circumstance, whether she has experienced financial struggles or a disjointed family, but I will talk to her first thing tomorrow as we hike. I’ll have to be sensitive of this kind of situation because I don’t know the exact details of her upbringing and what Renee does or does not want to share. I’ll make the first move and talk to her first, opening up about my family and my childhood, both good times and bad. In doing this, though, I’ll try my best not to simply set her aside and make a big fuss over what I might perceive as possible familial or financial issues. I don’t want to ostracize her even more from her peers, so I’ll try to find some common ground that she shares with perhaps Kelly and Jack, other introverted FOPer’s, and attempt to connect her with at least one sure buddy.

My second point of concern is Daniel. Daniel seems to be all-too-willing to please Philip with his own stories and too eager to “get trashed.” I want to make it very clear to all the FOPer’s that one does not have to drink alcohol to have fun or to fit in. I’ll work with my co-FOP leader to talk to the group about that in one of our discussion activities. Though again I’ll try not to single Daniel out, I’ll fall back tomorrow and talk with him one-on-one in the back of our hiking line to make sure he knows that drinking and partying is a choice, and that pressures to drink and party exist but that it is very worthwhile to drink responsibly. I won’t lecture, but instead talk gently and speak from my own experience freshman year, a time in which I chose to not drink but still had a phenomenal time. I’ll tell him about my sophomore year too when I went out more but always controlled myself, thus avoiding the many pitfalls and mistakes my friends made.

My third point of concern is Kelly. Her shivering is worrisome, and I want her to be healthy. I’ll press the importance of extra layers if she’s feeling cold, or if she’s seriously ill I will talk to my co-FOP leader about what possible actions to take, the most drastic being to call for help and even stopping our trip if Kelly’s condition worsens. Kelly is a sweet girl, but her silence might be more than a sign of introspection. I’ll attempt to initiate conversation with Kelly, Jack, and Renee so that all three may hopefully find similarities in their differences.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[Summers 2000-2003: Annual family camping trips in upstate Michigan – Not necessarily any significant outdoor knowledge gained on these trips but I’ve had an appreciation for the outdoors from an early age.

Spring 2005 & 2006: School sponsored camping trips into rural mountainous areas in Northern Japan – On these two trips we learned basic survival skills (building fire, building shelter, identifying edible plants, etc.) and spent just under a week outdoors.

Summer 2008 & 2009: 2-Week outdoor summer camping trips. Lived in cabins but spent days hiking, horseback riding, canoeing, and enjoying the outdoors.

July 2012: Spent two weeks in a village in rural Malawi on a mission trip to build a school. Experienced the elements, essentially living in harsh conditions.

20011-2013: Casual skiing and canoeing trips with friends at local state parks.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[The first strength I would have to name would be my ability to keep a level-head in high-stress situations, something that I believe leadership positions in high school have helped me develop. My mother likes to joke that I should be a heart surgeon because (apparently I wouldn’t be phased by the loss of a patient) but more seriously because I could maintain composure even with a patient’s life on the line. Essentially, I am good at thinking clearly and logically in situations where many others would struggle to do so. This would be helpful when leading a group of first-year students because living outdoors can be very unpredictable and so being able to handle disputes or injuries without panic would be essential for a successful trip. Another strength of mine would definitely my social skills. I firmly believe, and have often been told, that I am a very approachable person, even for people whom I have just met. I also believe that I can find a way to relate and interact with anyone I encounter, regardless of how different our backgrounds may be. Moving around while growing up, has taught me the importance of empathy when meeting people and making friends. This would be extremely helpful when building a relationship with the first-year students as well as gaining their trust. I also believe that maintaining morale on this type of trip would be very important and so being able to relate to the students would be essential in keeping everyone motivated.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[One thing I have learned through Harvard’s process of roommate selection is that regardless of how hard you try in the selection process, there is no guarantee of a perfect fit or even a good one. The likelihood of there being tension between the first-years is very high and if not addressed correctly, this could escalate and easily hinder the experience for the entire group. If splits begin to develop in the group or if the first-years stop talking to each other altogether then it would be a challenge to unify them and make sure they don’t miss out on the social aspect of the experience. Regardless of how confident I am with my social abilities, this would be a challenge. Another challenge for me would probably be pacing myself and the group during hikes. I understand the FOP trip is a very physically demanding experience and different people will respond to the physical activity in different ways. Recognizing that there will definitely be slower members of the group and ensuring that they are not being pushed too far outside their comfort zones would be hard for me to gauge. I’ve always been more athletic than most and there will likely be athletic first-year students, therefore, although this would be helpful in motivating the group to move forward, this could also prevent me from recognizing the need to take a quick break for those in the group who might need one.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[On the eve of Board elections for our High School Mock Trial team I was deciding whether or not to run as one of the co-presidents or as lead attorney. Frankly, I was pretty confident I would be elected to either position, however, I was already committed to several other clubs, so I was considering lead attorney, which had fewer responsibilities. I had a good friend of mine, who had been in the club for just one year, who had made a sort of verbal agreement with me that she would run for co-president and I would run for lead attorney. However, I later heard her talking about how little she cared about the club as a whole. She said she was only running for board so that she could put it on her resume and that she had no intention of putting any effort into the club. So the decision was to either let my friend take the higher position so that I wouldn’t be expected to dedicate more time than I was able to, or to run for co-president and do my best to fulfill the responsibilities knowing that my friend did not plan on dedicating any effort to the club. I was worried about spreading myself out too thin. I was worried about making sure our club would be successful the following year. I was worried about setting a good example for the younger members; and I was also worried about my friendship with this girl. In the end I decided to run for co-president because I felt like I had a responsibility to look out for the well being of the club and we ended up winning an Honorable Mention at State Finals.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[One of the concerns would have to be the fact that Renee, Kelly and Jack all seem to fading out of conversation and have been quiet on the trip. It is totally understandable that some people are just quieter than others but if you’re going to be spending a week in the wilderness with a group of people, the interactions between them would be very important. This is especially concerning with Renee as her quietness seems to have developed during the trip itself after having been conversational to begin with, whereas Kelly and Jack have been quiet since the beginning. The fact that Renee has become quiet implies that she is becoming less comfortable with her peers as opposed to more comfortable, which is one of the aims of any immersive outdoor experience. In any case, I would definitely try to get them more involved with the group through conversational activities that would help them to get to know the rest of the first-years and hopefully get them to open up and branch out.
	Another more serious concern would be the fact that Kelly is shivering consistently during breaks. Although I have no formal first-aid/medical training, the shivering is definitely a cause for concern. Whether she did not bring sufficiently warm clothing, or she hasn’t been eating enough (given that she gets full quickly), it would definitely be worth a talk with her. If she needed warmer clothing, perhaps one of the other students could lend her some or I could simply remind her of the importance of eating all of her food on such a physically demanding trip. Bottom line: the shivering would definitely be addressed.
	Finally, I would say the eye-roll from my co-leader Peter. Living in the outdoors can be physically and mentally draining on anybody and frustration could strike anyone but I feel like it is important that the FOP leaders maintain high spirits to motivate the group and not be the source of any doubt. I would most likely just pull Peter aside and ask him how he was doing, whether he needed anything and see if there was something that was actually bothering him. Then, without referencing anything specifically, I would tell him that we have to finish out the week strong and make sure that the group’s attitude doesn’t start going down hill. Most likely, Peter just needed a little push, but had one of the first-years seen the possible eye-roll, we wouldn’t want them thinking negatively of the leaders in anyway that we can prevent. In the end, it’s our job to make their experience great.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[As a child, I grew up in a family that found the wonders of nature analogous to a Guillermo del Toro horror film, wrought with danger and peril. My father did not see the value in making mud pies. My mother warned me of the probabilities of being struck by lightning and consumed by various woodland creatures. My brother found stargazing incredibly boring and my sister preferred to trek through the local shopping mall. However, to my parents’ chagrin, I have found ways to hike with my friends in our nearby Southern California deserts and mountains. With time, I have developed a deep appreciation and respect for nature. And I would love share an unique experience like FOP with other students.  ]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[October 2010: Leading Freshman Retreat as a Junior. I went to a Jesuit school and one 	of the oldest traditions of a Jesuit education is a weekend devoted to helping freshman transition from middle school to high school. Freshman Retreat seems quite similar to FOP.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[If I were to speak from my past experiences, I would say that I find it relatively easy to talk with a variety of people. I find it nearly impossible to be rude or mean towards others. I’m not exaggerating when I say that I don't have a "mean bone" in my body. Further, I am usually able to find ways to bring a group closer together, regardless of their differences or backgrounds — whether it is through a certain activity, starting a competition or any other method. I believe this ‘team-building’ quality stems from my high school experience. When I stepped onto the grounds of Xavier College Preparatory my freshman year, it was located in the middle of a desert with a total existence of two years and a student population of about 90 total students. Because of the minute size of our school, I learned a lot about how to bond in small groups. And thus, I’m fairly good at reading and addressing relationship dynamics. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I think that I’m a person who — if given a schedule — finds it really hard to deviate from that schedule. What I mean by that is sometimes I struggle to just let go and be spontaneous. For instance, I recall my first experience leading Freshman Retreat as a junior, I was excited because I had been planning for weeks what, where, and when we were going to do things everything. And I found myself biting my nails when we (my freshman and I) got off task. However, I think I’ve come to understand that what matters most about these kind of events is not the planning or being perfectly on time, it’s about the the freshman and the experience they get out of this.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[I think the toughest decision I’ve had to make in my nineteen years of existence was deciding to commit to Harvard. A couple weeks before the May 1st deadline, I had narrowed it down to Washington University in St. Louis and Harvard, but I was completely unsure how to choose between the two. I visited both schools and had two very different experiences: at Wash-U, I was a top recruit for football, received a full-ride scholarship and was very comfortable with the campus. However, I thought back to the insecure and angry person I was in middle school and how my parents’ decision to send me to my private high school had shaped me. Through brutal athletic training in hundred-degree weather, club leadership, a second family of caring teachers and unique friends, and unbelievable opportunities to serve my community, I discovered attributes within myself that I previously did not know existed or frequently disregarded. I realized that it was in places of ‘uncomfortableness’ that I grew the most. And I was incredibly uncomfortable with the idea of going to Harvard. I did not think that I would be able to measure up to the prestige and competitiveness of this institution. But I decided that I needed to continue to challenge myself in order to shape my future and feel proud of how I’ve developed at the conclusion of my college career. And I’m happy to say that I think I made the right decision.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[1) Renee: I know what it’s like to feel left out of a conversation and although I can’t force Lizzie and Matilda to befriend Renee, I can pull back and focus my attention on Renee (ask her about her family, her hometown, her expectations for freshman year, etc.) Sometimes, all someone needs is just one person to talk to in order to get enough confidence to venture out, rekindle a relationship or even form some new friendships. I don’t think that it is necessary to try and play matchmaker within this group of freshmen. There is still plenty of time; no need to rush.

2) Phillip: It’s natural for a gap-year student to feel more mature than the fellow students in his/her class and be extremely excited about telling others about his/her travels. However, when this ‘showboating’ attitude prevents the forming of relationships, it can be detrimental for the group’s dynamic. In this special case, I would wait for a moment when Phillip slips in a comment about his fellow ‘immature’ peers and just inform in a pleasant tone about how it wouldn’t hurt to try and get to know some of these students considering he is going to be in a class of about 2,000 of them. Some of them might surprise him. Friendship is not a matter of age. Personally, I’m friends with people who are still in high school and I have some friends who have already graduated college.

3) Kelly: It might be my ‘gentleman’ at heart, but it worries me that Kelly is shivering during these hiking breaks. If she doesn’t keep warm, she could catch a cold. However, if she has already said that she’s fine multiple times, I don’t want to be pushy and keep asking. Instead, I would discretely pull Jack aside and give one of the extra jackets we have hopefully packed (or my own) to him and ask him to give it to Kelly since they seem to be getting along pretty well.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[Youth:  As a stubby, fearless boy scout, I ascended the ranks from Tiger Cub to Wolf to Bear, and to Webelo.  During this time I would go on overnight wilderness trips with my family and develop a familiarity with the customs of group camping: helping to pitch tents, gather fire kindling from the surrounding area, and catching lizards.  Although I never led one of my Boy Scout expeditions, my exposure helped me become more comfortable with the outdoors.

		<Q7.2>I preserve a mentality of patience and trust and I get a thrill out of teaching.  Over the past few years, I have found a great capacity within myself for developing trust and being patient with people.  I have come to develop an appreciation for the power of patience and trust in unfamiliar situations.  Additionally, I enjoy teaching, mentoring, and learning from those whom I am privileged to lead.  Whether I'm helping my little brother with homework, showing a condom demonstration to a Tanzanian villager at soccer practice, or helping my FOPpers, I derive great satisfaction in helping others and will do everything I can to do so.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[ I think the greatest challenge for leading a group of first-year students would be wanting to explore more.  I love challenging myself outdoors and exploring new trails when I’m out running with buddies.  As a leader, I would have to remind myself to keep everything well within the limits of my group to ensure safety.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[There was a period of time last summer in Tanzania where I thought I had contracted malaria. I had been sick for two weeks and recognized the symptoms we had been taught in orientation earlier that summer.   I communicated this to my leaders and they said that it wasn't that big of a deal and that I should go to the local clinic the next day.  Knowing the pattern and potential severity of malaria, I chose instead to go to the larger town the next day for the bigger clinic, which would more accurately be able to test for malaria.  The larger town was slightly more dangerous, because of crime rates.  It became a trade-off between illness-risk and crime-risk and I chose to risk the crime because I thought I could handle it.  I worried my supervisors by making this decision, though I felt somewhat invincible to crime, so I didn’t think anything of it at the time.  Thinking back, I believe I made the right decision should have been in better communication with my supervisors.  I have come to learn that communication is everything.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[1.	I would worry about Kelly. I would worry mostly about her getting too cold and being too shy to say it. It’s one thing to be quiet, another thing to not want to talk about health- related issues.  Her unwillingness to talk about health-related issues makes me think that she either is experiencing physical, mental, or both types of issues.   She’s embarrassed by the issues affecting her, which makes it hard to address them in case they might affect her health in a serious way.  Therefore, it is my job to alleviate the embarrassment in order to get to the real problem.
First and foremost, in this situation I will be patient with her.  I will start to build her trust through kindness.  Hopefully this gets her comfortable enough so that she expresses the health-related issues that are on her mind.  If this doesn’t work fully, I might consider alleviating the embarrassment by using innocuous, self-deprecating humor.  The reason for this is that innocuous, self-deprecating humor, if done right, can break someone out of a shell created by vulnerability. She may feel vulnerable and therefore feel the need for a shell or barrier of communication between us.  I will make her feel relatively less vulnerable by revealing my own vulnerability.  Then, hopefully she will let down barrier.   If I see her shivering, I would say something directed at the issue of cold: “I don’t know if you noticed, but yesterday I just shivered my whole way up the hill.  I think I’ll ask Peter for an extra layer tonight … if you know what I mean ... he can really bring the heat … he lights my fire …” I exposed my vulnerability by showing my discomfort with the cold and that I am willing to accept the help of a leader, Peter.

2. Seeing as everyone else satisfied the safety requirement, I would start with, of those healthy, the person least happy as the next biggest issue.  I would identify Renee as that person.  She walks in close proximity to me, so I would strike up a conversation.  Solving Renee’s issue of unhappiness should be less difficult than the health issues of Kelly, because, unlike Kelly, Renee seems willing to talk.  I would turn around and talk to her on the hike.

3. The person I would be concerned of would either be Daniel or Jack.  From what I can tell, both are perfectly stable in health.  I would try to improve Daniel’s happiness talking to him and lessening his reliance on Phillip.  I would be only slightly worried about Jack since I don’t hear much from him.  I would try to figure out if Jack enjoys being quiet guy, or if he is hiding some problem, perhaps a problem of not having close buddies on the trip.  If enjoys solitude, I would leave him be, since this would give him happiness. If not, I would use a similar tactic on him to that of Kelly and Renee.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[- Summer 2013: Frequent (2-3x/week) hiking adventures in the foothills of the Sandia Mountains in my hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico. My friends and I would often spend entire days out in the mountains looking for great views and good times.
- August 2013: My FOP trip in the wilderness of Vermont. It was my first real backpacking/camping experience, so I tried to learn as much as I could and help the group however I could.]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2>In high school I volunteered as a little league baseball and softball coach where I got a chance to share some of my knowledge of my passion with younger kids. My senior year I was one of the captains of my high school's varsity baseball team, which was an invaluable leadership experience. </Q6.2>

		<Q7.1>1</Q7.1>
		<Q7.2>My senior year of high school we had a relatively young varsity baseball team -- only five seniors, a majority of juniors and a handful of sophomores. I fell into a leadership role because of my previous varsity experience, and I found myself in an interesting position where I had a chance to teach and befriend kids who were mostly younger than me. This experience taught me through trial and error what makes an effective leader -- not always being the most vocal guy but leading by example, offering encouragement or corrections when necessary -- and I think that my experience in relating to and leading younger students would benefit me in becoming a FOP leader. Along with this strength I would also list physical fitness, a love for the outdoors, and a generally positive disposition.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>I think my greatest challenges in leading a group of first-year students would be managing group dynamics and performing and teaching the "hard" skills of camping. While I did a good amount of managing group dynamics with my baseball team to try to keep everyone together and working toward a common goal, I had the advantage of knowing all my teammates fairly well. FOP offers an interesting challenge because a major part of it is getting to know everybody in your group, and I think getting to know people and simultaneously trying to manage their interactions will prove to be the most difficult part. As far as performing and teaching the "hard" skills, I feel this way mostly because I don't have any experience in these things besides my FOP trip, but it sounds like the training in the spring would adequately prepare me to handle these things in time. </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>I recall a recent excursion my family and I made to a popular chain seafood restaurant. I had been here before on many an occasion, and each time it continued to earn its spot among the top of my list of favorite eateries. We sat down, enjoyed some delightful bread rolls and satisfactory conversation, when finally it came time to place our order. As always, I asked for the maple-glazed salmon with rice pilaf, and it was then that I was obliged to make an exceptionally difficult decision: Soup or Salad? Knowing I had just a few seconds to make my decision before the ensuing silence became awkward, or, God forbid, I should have to ask the extraordinarily amiable waiter to "Come back to me," I quickly analyzed my situation. I thought back on previous visits and how my decision played out in the past, but this data proved insufficient. I ended up choosing the soup based on two major factors: my instincts, and considering which of the two I would more regret not having chosen if I were to pick the other. For the next few minutes I occasionally thought about the salad-that-could-have-been, but when that clam chowder hit my taste buds, I knew I had made the right decision.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[  Renee appears to be feeling left out from the group. I think this problem could be alleviated by encouraging Renee (and everybody else) to share stories about themselves during group activities. Jack and Kelly seem to be having a similar problem. While it could be that these two are just shy by nature, but encouraging them all to participate and open up in group discussions could help them to come out of their shells a bit. Renee's issue may also be stemming partly from the fact that Lizzie and Matilda appear to be forming something of an exclusive relationship. Reminding everyone in the group that exclusive relationships cause problems in the group dynamic and encouraging them to include everybody could benefit the group.
  Peter seems to be failing at a few of his duties. While leading the group down the wrong trail was probably an honest mistake, other behaviors of his are not acceptable in my opinion. Rolling his eyes at Peter, separating the group into competing units and therefore encouraging division, and warning FOPpers not to go near some caves that they would've otherwise not been aware of and thereby tempting them to go near them, are some issues that should be addressed. I would pull Peter aside, bring up these specific concerns, and remind him of his duties as a FOP leader to promote group unity and not encourage dangerous behavior. All in all, I think this group has a lot of positives and plenty of potential to be a successful FOP experience for everyone.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[- I grew up in rural Wisconsin, surrounded by forests and rivers. My earliest childhood memories consist mainly of exploring ravines, catching crawfish, and climbing trees with my friends. I’m very comfortable exploring the outdoors—it’s where I am my best self.

- April 2011: PADI Open Water Certification. Ever since, I’ve been an avid SCUBA diver, which has familiarized me with basic safety and survival skills.

- June 2011: Three day SCUBA trip to Catalina Island. Along with a few close friends, we explored kelp forests, befriended sea lions, and ate tons of food. I also cultivated a deep (get it?) interest in marine conservation.

- August 2011: Two week SCUBA expedition and service trip in Fiji. The outdoors allowed me to foster a deep connection with my host family in Nativi Village as we explored the local mountains and rivers.

- October 2012: Freshmen Retreat. I accompanied my school’s faculty and freshman class into the wilderness in an effort to create community among the freshman and to encourage genuine relationship-building. I had the pleasure of leading freshman as we hiked, zip-lined, kayaked, and climbed. Although faculty from my school were present, I was responsible for the safety of a group of freshman as we went through our activities. 

- August 2013: FOP! I learned basic outdoors skills like cooking, tarp set-up, backpack stuffing, and water purification. Not to mention the interpersonal skills that attract me back to be a FOP leader!

Reflecting back, nature has really been the place where I felt most true to myself. Hiking, kayaking, and SCUBA diving has allowed me to know myself and my friends in ways that I believe could only be achieved in nature. Not all of the outdoors are within my comfort zone, but I hope to challenge myself to go outside my comfort zone in an effort to grow personally.]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[- Sage Advocates of Multicultural Education: While at Sage Hill School, I taught students about multiculturalism, community, and cultural acceptance. A leadership group, SAME allowed me to engage with the freshman class starting on day one of their orientation; I led activities to bond a group freshman, and to promote embracing each other as unique individuals. This teaching experience taught me how to engage my peers in a cause that I felt passionately about, and to pass on my passion. I also worked with other members of SAME throughout the school year to create activities for the same group of freshmen, and acted as an advisor throughout their first year.

- Sage Hill Organic Garden: I co-founded a learning garden to teach students at my school and local elementary schools about the environment and food. With the help of a grant, we turned a half-acre of brush into a fruitful garden (with chickens!) and brought in students from local schools. I taught gardening workshops, nature-themed games, and children’s songs. Although the aim of the project was to teach, I had the opportunity to develop activities that felt more exciting and creative rather than educational. I also learned how to lead alongside a partner; we found ways to play up each others’ strengths and to take on responsibility when the other would need help. 

- Freshman Retreat, October 2012: I might add that my responsibilities also extended into community building — I made sure my group was having fun, I conducted activities for the students to bond, and I taught certain Sage Hill values (integrity, discovery, self-reliance) to the freshmen. Beyond guiding my group through outdoor activities, I also lodged and ate with them. Spending 72 hours straight with my group allowed me to know them on a very personal level. Teaching them required learning from them, which is very cliché, but central to my personal growth from the experience. ]]></Q6.2>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Every morning when I walk across Harvard Yard, I reflect upon my personal values. I find myself talking about my values with my friends, my roommates, and even my parents. Self-awareness, discovery, and community — these are the tenets that I constantly reflect on. If I were to lead a FOP trip, my greatest personal strength would be convincing my group of the inherent worth of FOP’s values — getting my FOPpers to “buy in.” 

The most important part of my personal FOP experience was the open environment that my FOP leaders created. It allows FOPpers to think, act, and speak freely. It allows them to bond, reflect, and find themselves. I believe that I can create this environment on a FOP trip, because it is a goal of mine to live that way, everyday.

To get out of my comfort zone, to act silly and to be my true self. I find it easy to do those things, and I find it easy to convince the people around me to be themselves. In every encounter I have, be it with a friend or stranger, I try to convey a sense of openness and grounded serenity. 

And I find that people respond to my attempts in just the way I hope. They see my openness, my willingness to be myself wholly, and they react by being their true selves. Those are the conversations, the interactions, that inspire me to be my best self.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[There exists a delicate balance between being a friend and being a leader. When I imagine myself as a FOP leader, I see two facets of myself that must interact carefully to produce an image of myself that my FOPpers see as caring, yet in control.

I can see myself leaning too far away from “control” and towards “caring.” It is my natural tendency to identify with people I meet, which would be problematic as FOP leaders need to assert themselves as decision-makers, and not just a fellow FOPpers. Being stern simply isn’t part of my personality.

Every great weakness has a remedy (or a “delta” in FOP lingo). But this delta would take more than my single efforts. Of course, I would need to remind myself that it is appropriate to sometimes be in control, to make decisions. Additionally, since FOP is led by two, I would ask my co-leader to assist me.

In order to establish a friendly, yet leader-like role, my FOP co-leader and I would have to work as a team to check both of our weaknesses. I would ask my co-leader to look for my weakness and help me work through it, just as I would help them. No single FOP leader is perfect, but by working together, FOP leaders get remarkably close.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[(I’ve changed the names in this response for reasons of confidentiality.)

As an only child, my experience living with roommates has been eye-opening. In my experience, dorm living has been one of the most important facets of learning here at Harvard, best exemplified by one particular incident—accidentally catching my roommate cheating on his girlfriend.

Alex had been a very upstanding roommate. I knew that he was a great person from our conversations and shared experiences. Seeing him in a new light pressured me to change my opinion of him, but I forced myself not to think differently of him until I had talked to him about the situation.

But confronting your roommate on something like that isn’t a simple matter. I considered whether it was my place to say something. I considered how a confrontation might alter our relationship. I considered Sophie, Alex’s girlfriend.

I decided to tell Alex that I had noticed some decisions he had made that I didn’t necessarily see as characteristic of his true nature. I didn’t say anything directly about infidelity, but I decided it was my responsibility to speak up. Even if the situation did not involve me, I felt an obligation as Alex’s friend to help him reflect.

Perhaps I should have acted more sternly, which is why I listed sternness as my weakness. But I stand by my decision to help Alex reflect. Alex had acted wrongly on two counts, betraying Sophie and betraying his values. By pointing out the latter issue, I knew that Alex would fix both.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[In the back country, severed from society, my first reaction is to make sure that every FOPper is safe. My supreme concern would be that of Kelly’s well-being. She’s clearly a wonderful FOPper to have on the trip, and demonstrates her kindness by sharing her desserts. But it’s my responsibility to make sure she is healthy, and that she is eating enough to recover from the demanding hikes.

Kelly has been shivering between breaks, which indicates the possibility that she isn’t eating as much as she needs to. It’s hard to gauge how much to eat on FOP, because our bodies work so much harder than they normally would. I would approach Kelly privately, after consulting Peter, and ask her how she’s doing. In a friendly way, I would recount my own shock in discovering how much more food I need to maintain myself on FOP, and encourage her to eat as much as she needs.

My second priority would be to ensure that everyone is fostering a sense of community and camaraderie. In order to reach that goal, both FOP leaders need to be completely on board. I noticed that Peter rolled his eyes during one of Phillip’s tales. In private, I’d tell Peter that I noticed, and that Phillip is just trying to impress Peter because Phillip looks up to Peter. I would remind Peter of his deep commitment to FOP’s values, a commitment that he has clearly demonstrated in his training to lead FOP. I would reinforce Peter’s commitment to FOP rather than challenge it. 

While the issue may seem small, it’s important that both FOP leaders completely “buy in,” so that the FOPpers can get the most out of their experience. The comfort of everyone on the FOP trip is vital to a successful trip. In order for every FOPper to bond and open themselves up completely, they must feel valued.

Renee hasn’t been valued by Lizzie and Matilda, and her response has concerned me. I’ve noticed her talking less and less, which is alarming. I would first talk to Peter, and then reach out to Renee. She seems to walk behind me, which is perfect because I have a wonderful opportunity to engage and connect with her. If she does not respond well to my attempts, I would privately take her aside to ask her if anything is bothering her. I would reassure her that I am there to be her advocate and friend. It is my goal to make sure that she is feeling comfortable and valued. I would tell her that I applied to lead FOP solely for that purpose — to foster confidence and friendship in freshmen before they arrive on campus. FOP is most important for people like Renee, because it is designed to create an environment for people to be her genuine self without repercussion. If Renee doesn’t feel like she can be herself, then Peter and I will have to reevaluate our whole approach to bond the group. It’s our job to do better.]]></Q7.5>

-Biannual weekend camping trips with most boys in the class and our dads. We camped and did activities like kayaking, archery and shooting flying orange discs. This program helped me bonding with my dad and class buddies. Everyone was given a trail name—my dad was Big Drummer and I was Little Drummer. Each father/son pair also was given an arrow, where the arrowhead represented the son and the guiding feathers represented the father. To this day, my dad and I still value this arrow as metaphor for our relationship. Wherever I point myself, he guides me. Indian guides was the first time I started feeling the magic of the outdoors and how powerful of a platform it can be to make interpersonal connections. 

May 2007 – Camp Kanuga 
-My entire graduating 6th grade class went on a weeklong camping trip in North Carolina. Activities included compass navigation, canoeing, kayaking and day hiking. The trip aimed to bond the 6th grade class before we all moved to different schools across the city. We played countless games and sang songs about friendship. Even now, I make Kanuga references with my friends. It was an incredible bonding experience that deepened my friendships and helped my transition to a new school in 7th grade—very similar to FOP!

July 2010 – South Carolina outdoor family vacation
-My family and I spent 5 days riding horses, hiking, and boating. We stayed together in a small cabin. This experience was the first all-family outdoor outing. We loved it! 

June 2011 – Cumberland Falls, Kentucky
-Family vacation! We spent 1 week hiking and boating with the family. We also stayed in a small cabin for this outdoor vacation.

June 2013 – Park City, Utah
-6-day trip with 3 friends after graduation. We did long day-hikes, carrying packs with water, lunch, and extra clothing layers. Some days, we even went running and biking on the trails. I helped plan the routes and keep the morale up when the paths got steep and the weather was hostile. I tended to carry the most equipment in my pack just to make sure everyone would have fun and not tire out too quickly. 

*Outdoor activities at home
-I live near the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, FL, so summer activities often include tubing, wakeboarding and waterskiing. I also spend most summers rowing (as in crew) and kayaking on the river. I bought my own kayak with all the necessary safety equipment and took a course to learn how to safely navigate my hometown river. My family lives off of a small creek, where I grew up exploring with my siblings and friends. Saturday nights spent camping in my backyard are some of my fondest memories as a kid. 

Summer 2013 – FOP Backpacking C!
A fantastic program that not only gave me the tools I needed to be prepared for freshman year but also introduced me to my most valued support group and friends on campus. I couldn’t have asked for more than that! Go FOP 23! 
]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Varsity Boys Crew Captain for Bolles Crew – 2012-2013  
-Voted by my teammates, I was the first junior captain elected to lead my high school varsity team. Serving for two years on a team of more than 50 boys, I made it my personal goal to learn everyone’s name and have an individual conversation with every guy on the team—even the middle schoolers. I made sure everyone was pumped to come to crew practice everyday and kept team/school spirit up. In order to encourage team bonding, I organized team outings away from practices and regattas. I helped crew come to be known as the team with the highest attendance and most school spirit at other Bolles sporting events throughout the year. At our competitions, we steadily improved over the years.  We went from never making the final round at the 2013 FSRA State Championships to our Men’s Varsity 8+ medalling for the first time in the competition, just behind a national championship winning 8+. It was an amazing journey, and I was honored to not only lead, but also be a part of a group of such dedicated, driven guys whom I’m proud to call my teammates. 

Language Tutor at my high school – senior year
-Enrolled in AP Spanish, AP French and AP Chinese at Bolles, I tutored struggling first and second year students in their foreign language classes. In order to make best use of our one-hour long sessions, I contacted his or her instructor and reviewed copies of tests and quizzes to pinpoint where the student was lacking understanding. Teachers would say that students seldom participated in class, which was hurting their grade. But students explained how they stayed quiet to avoid feeling dumb in front of their peers. To combat this fear, I focused on one-on-one tutoring to build confidence in speaking, grammar and vocabulary, all while having fun learning a foreign language. Every student improved a great deal and embraced foreign language study with more fervor. It is such a gratifying experience to see students’ eyes light up when a concept “clicks.” Tutoring also helped me reinforce my own language skills. 

Chinese Twin Bridge – senior year
-Coordinator for Twin Bridge at Bolles, a language exchange program between the American students who are taking Chinese and the Chinese international students. I also helped spearhead the Chinese Club and Chinese Culture Week on campus. At the Florida Statewide Chinese Competition, I was voted team captain and organized a cultural performance. I loved seeing American students and Chinese students come together with such excitement and learn so much from each other. It was a natural process of curiosity and friend making—it just needed a facilitator.

Chair of the annual Blood Alliance Blood drive – senior year
-I spread awareness across the school community about the need for healthy blood donors. My mom gives annually to the Florida-Georgia Blood Alliance, a Jacksonville-based blood bank. In 2000, my dad was in desperate need of a kidney transplant, but acquisition of an organ took longer than expected. Thanks to a generous donor, he is currently alive and well, but I remember the scary nights worrying my Dad wasn’t going to make it.  Healthy donors of blood and organs save lives without even knowing it. I felt a very personal connection to this community initiative. 

Dedicated new rowing shell to Col. Joseph Kittinger, Bolles Alum c/o ’46 – Junior Year
-Represented the men’s rowing team at a boat dedication ceremony. In 1960, Kittinger set the record for the longest skydive from a height of 102,800 feet, over 19 miles. I gave a speech to the community about how courage and audacity are crucial to winning boat races. He was a great inspiration to our team and having the opportunity to express those sentiments to him directly was an honor.

Host for Exchange students
-From sophomore to senior year, I hosted students from Spain, France and China in my home. Depending on their English fluency, I varied how much we communicated in their native language and in English. This way, I could optimize their learning of culture and customs. We each did our best to help the other better understand cultural differences. These experiences brought my language classes to life, all while giving me the opportunity to forge amazing international friendships.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[•	I am the type of person who loves to bring different types of people together. I do my best to give myself the tools necessary, like languages and cultural understanding, to connect with a wide range of people. Most of my friends back home use me a focal point to build friend groups. 

•	I am a good listener. Other people’s stories genuinely interest me and I’m a true believer in the idea that you can learn something from anyone. That being said, I won’t hesitate to tell my own story. Openness by all parties is essential for mutual understanding and comfort. 

•	Having enjoyed a wide variety of friends, I have developed a sensitivity to different expressions of emotion. I’m a thoughtful and analytical person, thinking before I act and acting with purpose.

•	I value the group dynamic. Within friend groups, I don’t tend to favor one person over another. Instead of excluding people so I can spend time with a friend one-on-one, I often try to include several friends such that we may share collective experiences. I’ve noticed that this gives my friend groups more “crossover”—more stories to tell, more shared laughs, and more fun—all elements conducive to great friendship. Nevertheless, I value alone time with my friends, especially ones with whom I share my more inner thoughts. One-on-one is the best way to deeply connect. 

•	ENTHUSIASM! I love life and the people I share it with. Fundamentally, I’m an optimist and prefer to look at the bright side of things.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[•	I would fear not being representative of the many facets of Harvard. Since we live on such a diverse campus with so many activities and interests, I would hate no to know the answers to questions my FOPpers may have. My FOP group inundated our leaders with questions about clubs, social life, academics, and sports. They did an amazing job helping us better understand Harvard, especially for me since I had never visited the campus before pre-orientation. Explaining Harvard to someone who isn’t part of our community still seems like a difficult task.

•	Because I’m a thoughtful person, I tend to over-analyze certain situations. I don’t want to always assume there is a problem in the group, but I also want to remain conscious of the group dynamic. It’s definitely a careful balance. 

•	I’m physically very active, so I tend to like moving fast on the trails. I also love the rigor and the challenges one faces in the backcountry. A high point in my FOP group’s bonding was after a long, tiring day with rain and high rocks just after Mt. Washington. We persevered together and made a memory along the way. I fear not having this physical struggle on an A or B trip. Sometimes I felt like even our C trip took too many stops, so I’d have to stay aware of the physical state of my FOPpers.

•	I’m also pretty bad at remembering how to play group games. On FOP, we played so many and I found myself struggling to keep up! Some serious studying would be necessary…
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Over FOP, I decided to tell everyone that I went to fat camp not once, not twice, but three different times. Now, I’m a heavyweight rower here at Harvard, so I can joke about it, but it still remains a sensitive area for me.

The stigma about overweight kids is that we’re all spoiled, lazy gluttons without any self-control. Living in an athletic community with healthy parents and sporty younger siblings made it tortuous to be the odd one out. Admittedly, I had problems with portion control and couldn’t seem to understand when enough was enough. 

In 5th grade, my parents decided to do me a favor and send me away to lose weight, but I resisted. For 2 weeks, I learned how to eat right and care for myself physically.

Still, it only took me a couple months after returning home to gain the weight back. I went the following year only to hit the same wall. I finally took my health into my own hands. In 8th grade, I joined crew, which gave me an exercise schedule and motivation.

Telling FOP was terrifying. Friends back home knew, but I had only been on FOP for two days. Would they judge? Laugh? I didn’t want to be perceived as weak—my biggest fear since most fat kids are stereotyped weak-bodied and weak-minded. 

But I remembered the safe space we all promised each other on FOP, and I felt it was such a key part of my identity that needed to be shared. My past weakness became my current strength. I’m so glad I made this decision.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[I see one main problem with our FOP group: we haven’t bonded as a whole yet. Little duos have sprung up where friends are being made, in the case of Lizzie and Matilda or Mark and Suzy, or trying to be made, like Daniel’s attempts to interest Philip. The FOPpers are getting exclusive in their friend selection, which is NOT good for the group dynamic. I think this problem stems down from a lack of communication between Peter and me. Before FOP, we should have established values and goals for the trip that we constantly reinforce. If we didn’t make a bandana with these values sharpie-d in, I would make one and rotate it around the group. I need to first make sure Peter is okay since I noticed an eye roll earlier. Maybe he’s upset or just annoyed. Either way, we should talk about it. 

If Peter and I are on the same page, we could more easily bring the group together. The sensation of exclusion that Renée and Daniel (and maybe even Kelly and Jack!) are feeling would disappear. Maybe Lizzie, Matilda and Phillip would be more conscious of the group and work to incorporate everyone. Mixing up the hiking order could also fix the exclusive friend issue. Again, these problems are not in the FOPpers, they’re in the leaders. 

However, have no fear, I think we can fix this problem. In order to increase group morale, I think Peter’s idea of a competition is a bad one and we should actually work together to put up each tarp. Then, Peter will cook with Phillip and Daniel (to give Mark a break) while actively engaging Daniel in the conversation. He could even address Harvard’s diverse social scene, since Daniel seems to be mentioning “getting trashed” pretty often. 

Meanwhile, I will take the other FOPpers one by one and have a little individual session. Around the halfway point on my trip, our leaders did this to ensure we were comfortable and having a good time. 

During dinner, I’ll go around asking everyone their “rose, bud and thorn” of the day. Then, maybe go around the circle telling our “getting into Harvard” stories. Everyone can relate to this, and it would get everyone in a “feel good” mood. Since it was a long day, we proceed to bear bag and set up camp for the night. 

When I was on FOP, my favorite activity involved writing our biggest fears, a challenge we’ve faced, a funny story, an accomplishment, or what we want to keep and change about ourselves going into freshman year all onto a notecard. We then each spent 5 minutes explaining our notecard to the group. Finally, we passed the notecard around the circle and wrote a word that we think describes that person. The ambiance of our headlamp-lit water bottles and hearing everyone’s stories made for an incredible hour of bonding. The feelings of shared struggles and understanding were palpable. At this point on this FOP trip, the shield-activity would be the ideal activity to transform this experience from individuals hiking in the woods to a group of close friends ready to tackle freshman year.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[January 2013:  Wintersession program at the Harvard Forests Petersham, MA. I spent 7 days there exploring the land and learning about the various ecological experiments and conservation efforts taking place at the forest. This experience fostered a deep appreciation of the forest and a deeper understanding of how human impact alters the landscape. 

July 2011: 4 day hiking trip, 23 miles round trip, hosted by the University of California Los Angeles Unicamp Wilderness Adventure and Leadership Learning program. I participated as a high school camper and this was my first experience with backpacking through the wilderness. I think this trip was very much like FOP, and I really enjoyed it. 

On top of these experiences, I have gone on various hikes on trails ranging from 2 to 8 miles round trip. Although my hiking and camping experience is not extensive, I have always wanted to be outdoors and partake in those activities. I just never had the resources or knowledge to spearhead any trips of my own. I would really love to learn more and become a more experienced outdoors(wo)man.
]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Chinatown Citizenship September 2012 – April 2013. This program is run through PBHA, and as a volunteer, I taught civics in Chinese to a group of immigrant adults ranging from 40-60 years of age on Sunday afternoons. They would ultimately have to take the test in English so I had to spend a lot of time on their pronunciation of words and the definitions. I understood that it would be hard for them to remember information in a language that is not their own especially with their age group, so I really focused on having them understand the structure of the government instead of just memorizing answers to questions. For example, I drew flow charts and diagrams on the chalkboard, which gave them an extra visualization of the material; this not only helped them follow the logic of the US government, but also helped me guide them through the questions that would be asked during the exam. Words and questions were also repeated many times until every single student pronounced them correctly. This experience taught me patience and new methods of teaching. 

Chinatown Afterschool February 2013 – April 2013 This was also run through PBHA. Every Wednesday we would travel to Chinatown and provide afterschool tutoring. I worked with first graders, helping with homework and leading daily projects. From this I learned different styles of teaching, the main goal being, allow the students to arrive at the answer themselves but it is okay to provide some guidance. We also strove to develop creative power and teamwork with the daily projects, comprising of, but not only, art, culture, and science. 

Chinese Students Association (CSA) Cultural Chair (Executive Board) Jan 2013 – Dec 2013 CSA is one of the largest most active cultural organizations on campus, throwing and average of two events per week ranging from speaker dinners to cultural study breaks. I was in charge of planning the study breaks, and this year I have planned 9 with an expected attendance between 60 -150 people. These study breaks build help foster community and build the center of the cultural aspect of the club. From this, I have shown responsibility, the capacity to logically think ahead, and to be creative. 


Chinatown Kung Fu and Lion Dance Troupe July 2007 – Aug 2012 This was my longest and most favorite high school activity. I served as captain for two years, leading practices and teaching choreography. I also helped build team coherence in a multiracial and multigenerational group. I also attribute a lot of my growth as an individual to this activity, instilling in me strength and confidence. ]]></Q6.2>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I believe that everyone should have laughter in their lives, and when people are not in serious situations, it is okay to be goofy as long as it is controlled; therefore I love to provide new energy and create laughter with those around me. Sometimes I feel like I have an endless source of energy and can be around others forever. However, I am not over the top that it turns to be uncomfortable or annoying. Because I want everyone to have a great time, I constantly check in with people to make sure they are having fun. Over the years, being involved in many group activities, I have developed a keen sense towards people’s feelings and a habit of being observant. I am also generally an enthusiastic person, especially when it comes to being outdoors and having new experiences, so maybe it can help get the group going. I think these traits can help me generate an environment that I is casual, happy, and inviting for my FOPpers. Being able to generate that kind of relaxed environment for first year students would be a great way to help them build friendships and give them a positive outlook on their first days at Harvard.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>I think that it might be hard for first years to realize that they are stepping into a school where everyone is qualified to be there, and their former high school success is shared among others at Harvard. While it is okay for first years to have confidence walking into an institution like Harvard, their egos should be watched. I think that it might be hard to control those egos as well as ease them into the fact that others are just as qualified and maybe even more. As a result, this could be a potential problem for team dynamics during the hike. </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One time I was in the grocery store and I had to decide between Honey Bunches of Oat or Captain Crunch cereal. Honey Bunches was on sale for $3.50, but Captain Crunch was only $2.98 at CVS. Both were so delicious and sweet, just what I needed. I had walked in looking for Captain Crunch, but Honey Bunches, my favorite cereal, was more than 50 cents cheaper! This cereal was to be eaten in the time I was home for break, so I had to chose something that would be sustainable and enjoyed through out my stay. Captain Crunch will satisfy me momentarily but it will get tiring in the long run. So I chose Honey Bunches. Although it is in a smaller box I can enjoy it for longer, and I can purchase another breakfast food other than cereal to last the whole break. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[	 In this scenario, it is already the third day of hiking, but the group isn’t working as a team; cliques are forming and people are being left out. I think that this is an unhealthy environment for a group that is traveling and working together to ensure a successful hike, as well as creating an uninviting situation for some of the FOPpers. Although everyone will bond to different degrees, I think that everyone should have more of a chance to create that bond with other members. If the hike is about to get tougher, building a team environment will help move the hike along because those that are stronger can watch out for those who are weaker by physically supporting them over an obstacle or giving moral support. Another thing to do is to communicate this concern with your co leader and together figure out what roles each member can contribute to the culture of the group that can highlight individual strengths. This way, everyone can feel like they contribute to the group, and others will also feel their presence. This will eventually foster a deeper bond and insight into an individual’s personality. 

	Highlighting an individual’s personality might help Renee’s case. At Harvard there many who have had diverse Lizzie’s and Matilda’s family, either because their family has the money to do so or their families have a wider range of values that include family vacations to different places. There is also a smaller population of Harvard students who do not have that kind of money or their parents don’t have the knowledge about different travel places and experiences. It can be uncomfortable for the few that do not come from “privileged” backgrounds, and Rene might be becoming more aware of her family background. At this point, it would be good to reach out to Lizzie and ask her about her background, and hint that being uncomfortable because of different family backgrounds is not an isolated feeling at Harvard. There are others who feel that way, and from time to time that divide is more apparent than others; however, there are many more times where connections across backgrounds can be made. 

	Lastly, I would highlight Mark’s heavy load going into a more challenging terrain. In the morning, I would re-assign the group equipment, taking into account individual fitness, and the fact that we have consumed three days-worth of food, so some packs will be lighter. Also, this might be a good start in feeling a team effort in this hike and fostering a community sense. In Mark’s case, it might be helpful to talk to him about teamwork and not taking on too many tasks himself. Being a leader does mean to take on more responsibility, but it also means efficiently utilizing a team. This leadership trait can be taught to Mark and others.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[Summer 2005-2008: As a 12- to 15-year-old camper at Camp Agawam in Maine, I did ~2 weeklong trips each summer to Mt. Katahdin and the Presidential range, and canoeing trips on Moosehead and other lakes in Maine. This is where my appreciation, comfort in, and love for the natural beauty of my home state and the outdoors in general began to take hold. I loved the physical challenge of each trip, and, looking back, I benefitted from the emotional challenge of spending all of my time with a group in the wilderness, which was a recipe for members to inevitably storm or get frustrated with each other. If I went into the trip with a few close friends, I would always emerge with even more close friends (even ones I hadn’t expected to befriend before) once we got back to Agawam. On these trips, and during my 7 weeks each summer at Agawam, I gained wilderness/survival skills, canoeing skills, and an overall sense of comfort, enjoyment, and freedom in the woods and the mountains. This past summer as a full-time counselor at Agawam, I led a few shorter hiking trips for younger campers in which I planned our routes, amassed and organized food from camp’s Trip Room, helped pack campers’ packs, and taught campers cool skills like setting up tents -- but last summer I dedicated myself mostly to teaching windsurfing and working back at camp. I loved talking about WFA and WFR with my many fellow counselors who’d done the programs. Although I have some solid experience in the outdoors, I really want to take it to the next level and dedicate more of my focus to trip leading this summer and beyond!

My whole life: Growing up in Maine, I was instilled with an appreciation for the outdoors from an early age. A healthy percentage of my most formative experiences happened in the woods, or at least nearby. My favorite thing in the world is to be outside, preferably in nature, (I’d do anything to be writing this from my back porch surrounded by evergreen goodness at home in Maine instead of Lamont, but that’s another story…). My enjoyment and comfort in the outdoors would provide a sturdy foundation for my skills as a FOP leader.

Spring Semester 2013: In India, I spent a month acclimatizing and hiking in Leh, Ladakh, in the heart of the Himalayan mountain range. In addition to being the singular most amazing month of my life, I learned a lot about what it means to be part of a group, to appreciate that people have different paces, and to love hiking for the beauty and the camaraderie and the physical, interpersonal, and emotional challenges – not just the speed and “the zone.”

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[High school:

During my junior and senior years of high school, I volunteered after school at the Boys and Girls Club of South Portland. I have two younger siblings and I’ve always loved being a big brother, but at in this role, I could do so for kids who didn’t always have that kind of big brother influence in their lives. We’d organize all sorts of games and I’d teach and essentially help babysit them for a few hours after school. While it wasn’t teaching per se, my experience at the Boys and Girls Club made me want to be a camp counselor, and started to give me skills that I’d expand upon in other teaching roles to come.

For two summers in high school, I worked for eight weeks at a day-camp in Maine called Fish Camp. A quirky, fun camp with a sideline emphasis on marine education and marine biology, Fish Camp was the first place where I intentionally made a point of looking out for kids who were shyer, or might get teased at their school, or who came from difficult situations at home. As the weeks went on, this become more and more important to me, and it carried over into all facets of my life. In addition to this, as a counselor, I taught all sorts of activities – from the standard to the completely wacky. It was valuable to be forced to teach, rather than to play a secondary role while an older counselor did it, because it threw me into the uncomfortable, unfamiliar role of the teacher, which could be difficult at first, but which became extremely rewarding.

In high school, I was president of the joint World Affairs Council/Model UN team. For Model UN, as I got older, a large part of my responsibility was to help younger students gain new skills in research, debate, and negotiation in preparation for the conferences we attended at colleges all around the U.S.

College:

Summer 2013: I worked at Camp Agawam as Activity Head for Windsurfing, one of biggest activities at camp, and as head counselor in a cabin of fourteen-year-olds. At Windsurfing, I managed a team of 6 other staff members, trained them, planned activity periods for the campers, bought a bunch of sweet new gear, and had an incredible summer teaching and improving our teaching skills together. I always emphasized that as instructors, it was our main responsibility to get to know the needs of each camper first – their personality, their skill level, their strengths and weaknesses, whether they’re homesick, who they’re friends with or want to be friends with – and to keep this in the front of our minds as we taught them to windsurf. There was no better feeling in the world than a camper in my cabin, Miguel, who didn’t know how to swim at the beginning of the summer ultimately learn to windsurf and execute a smooth gibe during the last weeks of camp. 

HSA: At school, I’m the Operations Manager for The Harvard Shop, a salaried management position on the FY15 team at Harvard Student Agencies. Working with the Managing Director of the store, I’m in charge of overseeing all operations – from sales to scheduling. But my favorite part of the job is working with the Sales Associates; during training, I show them how to engage with customers, and try to use my own enthusiasm to inspire them to deliver the best possible customer service they can!

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[As a part of my personal philosophy, I make a point of looking for and really enjoying the value of each person I meet or interact with. Coupled with my sense of enthusiasm and outgoing attitude, this would make me an approachable, welcoming, and fun FOP leader. Practically speaking, I’m an experienced outdoorsman who’s participated and led many trips in the New England outdoors since a young age. From working in groups like these and in many others, I know what it’s like to be in groups that are forming, norming, storming, or performing; I appreciate the insight to be taken from each of these stages, and my experience as a mediator within groups can help move groups from stage to stage. Moreover, I love introducing people – whether campers or friends – to the beauty of the outdoors, and the rewarding challenges to be met and overcome when you’re there. And lastly, pervading many of these qualities is my sense of self-awareness and the extraordinary value that I see to personal reflection, for the benefit of others and myself. My sense of compassion, my desire to work with people, my desire to listen, empathize, and put myself in others’ shoes when I’m teaching or working with them – all of these can be traced back to self-awareness, which in turn can be traced to personal reflection. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[The biggest challenge I would face as FOP leader, I imagine, would relate to the fact that FOP brings together students who don’t know each other, but each of whom is full of emotions, aspirations, and fears about entering Harvard (and, most likely, about entering the wilderness with a bunch of people they don’t know). I’ve been on trips in the mountains where people have clashed, but I imagine the nature of bringing all these people together would make things even more likely to be tough at times. This challenge motivates me rather than daunting me, because it would provide an opportunity for me to facilitate a safe space in which Harvard students who might not have interacted much at school if they hadn’t come together in the outdoors beforehand to get to know each and bond.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[When I was in the Himalayas, I was in a close-knit group of twelve students who’d just spent two months working and learning together in Varanasi, India. But when we went on our first few short hikes in the Himalayas to begin the acclimatization process, it became clear that a few members of our group wouldn’t be able to do the 10-day trek that lay ahead. In order to deal with the situation, we met for four hours one day and discussed, wavered, broke down, and ultimately came to the decision that we should go on a shorter 3-day trek instead. During the conversations, I was extremely torn and made my difficulties know to the whole group, who was feeling similarly. I’d been looking forward to the trek during my entire time in India, and while I was upset by the prospect of not getting to do it, I became a vocal proponent of the shorter trek during our discussion. Doing the trek had seemed important, but how much I valued my friends who were daunted by the long trek and felt guilty for not being able to do it overrode my own desire to challenge myself and reach a summit in the Himalayas. Group safety, and the compassion I’d been intentionally trying to cultivate during much of much time in India, were more important.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[In this scenario, my biggest concern would center on my co-leader, Peter. The more minor aspect of my concern is when Peter seemed to roll his eyes at Phillip’s story of trekking in the alps. While it seems minor, and it’s unclear whether Phillip noticed, what’s important is that if I noticed, then someone else might notice in the future, including Phillip. This would be a bad progression of events, as it would create a negative environment for the whole group especially Phillip for the group leader to at least be perceived as having a negative perception of him. Regarding Peter, in a bigger sense, my concern is that he might not have the FOPpers’ safety in mind as much as he should. While a race might be awesome for some, it could put too much strain on slower FOPpers, especially with a big day again. Unnecessarily tiring the group out is never a smart move safety-wise. I would talk to Peter and end up strongly suggesting we not split up the groups. This isn’t a good idea – if Peter were to get injured, it would be important to have both leaders on the scene to deal with the situation as trained.

My next concern would be the situation with Renee. I wouldn’t want her to think that because of her background, friendships at Harvard would be inaccessible to her. Her quietness suggests this sentiment might be brewing in her. It’s a negative stereotype about Harvard, and certainly a concern for many students entering their freshman year (I definitely felt this way myself). Thirdly, I’d be concerned about the situation between Phillip and Daniel. I wouldn’t want Phillip to ignore Daniel and possibly view him as immature because he talks about partying. Furthermore, I wouldn’t want it to seem like Phillip is elevated in the group by his relationship with Peter, or for other group members to feel that they are less mature than him.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[•	August 2013: 6 day switch-canoe B FOP trip in Flagstaff, ME. I helped set up/take down tarp, ration pack loads, bear bag, fill up water bottles, and wash the dishes.
•	August 2013: Day hike in Blue Hills Reservation in Milton, MA with 2 friends. I helped navigate the route.

Besides my own FOP trip and a day hike I took with a few of my friends at the end of last summer, I admittedly haven’t had much experience with the outdoors. However, this is precisely (part of the reason) why I want to become a FOP leader – to have the ongoing opportunity to become familiar with the outdoors and join a community of others who are passionate about doing the same. Though I enjoy being outside, coming from a family that isn’t particularly adventurous or athletic, I never had exposure to weekend/weeklong trips or even day hikes and thus never considered myself an “outdoorsy” person. This was why when I applied for pre-orientation trips last summer, FOP was unquestionably my first choice: I wanted to have the chance to do something completely new, and change the limits of my self-conception in the process. My FOP trip was my first real outdoor experience, and it has been undoubtedly the best decision of my freshman year so far. It gave me a taste of what being fully immersed in the wilderness is all about – the self-reflection, the sense of peace, and the solidarity and strength of the relationships you build with the people who you share the experience with. FOP was truly a life-changing experience for me in that I came out of FOP feeling empowered and renewed, a much more confident, invigorated, and positive version of myself, with a new appreciation for nature, my fellow FOPpers as human beings, and an excitement for meeting the rest of the Harvard community. Because of my trip, I fell in love with everything that FOP is and embodies, and I am sure I could not have had such a positive experience without the facilitation of my wonderful FOP leaders. This, essentially, is why I want to learn the skills and gain the familiarity with the outdoors necessary to become a FOP leader – so I can help shape the growth/transition process for future freshmen, helping them to discover their love for the outdoors while rediscovering themselves as individuals and as members of a larger community. I want to create an unforgettable experience for future FOPpers in their transition to college, much in the same way that my FOP leaders did for me.

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[•	Summer 2009: Teaching Assistant, Lexington Community Education’s summer program for kids K-8. I helped teach science classes to kids K-2 and 3-4.
•	Fall 2009 – Summer 2013: Teaching Assistant, Lexington School of Ballet. I participated in the work-study program at my dance studio, leading combinations, demonstrating technique, and serving as role model for younger dancers. I TAed classes ranging from grade 2 to teen/adult.
•	Summer 2011: Counselor-in-Training, Josiah Willard Hayden Recreation Centre’s summer dance camp. I helped teach dance classes and lead other camp activities.
•	Fall 2011 – Summer 2013: Flute Teacher, self-employed. I taught local elementary/middle school students basic flute/music technique in a one-on-one setting. This was probably the most challenging but educational teaching experience I’ve had, because of the sheer difficulty of teaching young children a skill as complex as how to read music or play an instrument for the first time.
•	Fall 2011 – Spring 2013: Arts & Entertainment editor, later Editor-in-Chief, Lexington High School newspaper. I trained my staff writers and fellow editors in good journalism ethics and technique, coordinated staff communications and meetings, and in general, led the paper’s production process.
•	Fall 2011 – Spring 2013: Founder and President, Lexington High School Dance Club. I founded my high school’s first dance club and ran club operations, taught class, and choreographed pieces for the group.
•	Fall 2011 – Spring 2013: Senator, Lexington High School Student-Faculty Senate. I served as an elected representative in student government, voicing the interests of my grade and the student body overall and forming school policy accordingly.
•	Fall 2011 – Spring 2013: Member, National Honor Society. I chose to do most of my volunteer work with children in an educational setting. This included helping autistic children with arts and crafts at a holiday party, teaching kids science at an annual elementary school science fair, and assistant-teaching an outdoor vacation camp at Drumlin Farm in Lincoln, MA.
•	Summer 2012: Intern, Mike Barrett for MA State Senate elections campaign. Along with other high school/college students, I canvassed door-to-door and phone-called to get a local resident elected to the state senate. This experience taught me the value of cohesive teamwork, and also was key to my development into a more confident, outgoing person.
•	Fall 2012 – Spring 2013: Founder and President, Lexington High School YouthTrade Club. Inspired by my experience interning with a nonprofit called Youth Entrepreneurship and Sustainability, I created my school’s YouthTrade Club to foster student entrepreneurship and encourage conscious consumerism.
•	Fall 2012 – Spring 2013: Flute Section Leader, Lexington High School Wind Ensemble. As leader of the flute section, I took attendance, distributed parts and music, and coordinated section workshops.
•	Fall 2012 – Spring 2013: Co-Leader, Lexington High School Flute Choir. I organized rehearsals and chose repertoire for our entirely student-run ensemble.
•	Fall 2013 – Present: Freshman Leader, Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business. I helped WIB directors organize the 9th annual Intercollegiate Business Convention.
•	Present: Treasurer, Harvard Ballet Company. I was recently elected to Harvard Ballet Company’s board as treasurer. I am responsible for managing all internal and external financial transactions.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think my emotional awareness, open-heartedness, open-mindedness, optimism, perseverance, focus, responsibility, and enthusiasm would be some of my strengths in leading a group of first-years. One of FOP’s foremost goals is to provide a smooth transition for freshmen by building a sense of community and belonging even before college starts. In order to facilitate the easy and open communication that leads to this bonding, FOP leaders have to be able to connect on an emotional level with their FOPpers and lay the foundations for trusting relationships. My acute sensitivity to others’ thoughts and feelings and my ability to empathize and really listen would help me to accommodate the needs of my FOPpers, negotiate interpersonal conflicts, and foster healthy, safe social environment. Implicit in building community is the aim to promote inclusion and equality among FOPpers, and my appreciation of others’ differences and willingness to embrace them would help to bridge disparities, whether gender-specific, racial, cultural, religious, or socioeconomic. In addition to creating a safe social setting, FOP leaders need to create a physically secure environment as well. My responsibility and good judgment would keep the group out of any potentially dangerous situations and ensure strict adherence to safety protocol. Finally, given the uncertainty and capriciousness of natural conditions, leading an outdoor trip also requires resilience and positivity, and my optimism, perseverance, and enthusiasm for FOP would help keep the group outlook upbeat throughout the trip, even in times of bad weather or difficult hiking.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[Walking the thin line between friendship and leadership would be one of my biggest challenges in leading a group of first-years. It’s easy to just be friends with everyone, but it is much harder to be the friend that everyone also respects, especially since as a sophomore, I would be very close in age with the FOPpers. As a people-pleaser, I would have to be conscious of not just pleasing everyone in the group, but making sure I am making the right decision in terms of the safety and wellbeing of the group. I would have to know when to be silly and fun with my FOPpers and when to be “that person” who gets everyone up in the morning, limits meal portions, and gets the group to camp on time. Identifying with FOPpers while still maintaining a sense of authority and responsibility for them may be difficult, but it’s key to creating a physically and socially sound experience for each FOPper. Another one of my challenges might be my relative inexperience with the outdoors/lack of technical skill. Though I can put up a tarp and steer a canoe, I wouldn’t consider myself super fit or very advanced in outdoor skills. Some FOPpers might be stronger, faster hikers than me, so my challenge would be not to be intimidated, to trust that my training has served me well, and to remember that it’s not physical prowess but the personal qualities and leadership ability that make a good FOP leader.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[A difficult decision I made was a recent one – deciding not to apply to be on Harvard Radcliffe Modern Dance Company’s (HRMDC) board. Though this may seem like an instance of backing down from responsibility, I know I made the rational – and right – decision. The night before board applications were due, the directors began aggressively soliciting applications from the freshmen. They not only approached me during company class, but also personally called and emailed urging me to apply. I was flattered by their insistence, but worried I wouldn’t have the time in my schedule to take on this additional commitment: I had already applied to directorships in two other organizations, I knew my work week would increase from 8 to 10 hours next term, and I wanted to audition for another dance group in the spring, in addition to juggling academics. I wanted to say yes, because I really liked my fellow dancers, and I felt I owed my rediscovery of dance to HRMDC, but I knew that saying yes would be overstretching myself in a way I didn’t want. The day applications were due, I deliberated: on one hand, I could apply, giving in the directors’ pressure; on the other hand, I could choose not apply, giving up the leadership opportunity in order to preserve my sanity. Though it was hard, I ultimately said no because I realized if I applied, it would not be because I really wanted to but because I felt pressured to.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[•	Kelly’s shivering is my foremost concern, because physical safety/wellbeing comes first. If the shivering was only an isolated incident, it may not warrant as much concern. However, because of the earlier thunderstorm and Kelly’s consistent shivering, I have cause for more concern. Even though she claims she’s fine, I would tell her to put on extra layers of clothes and make sure she puts them on, because I wouldn’t want to risk her getting a chill from being drenched and cold from the rain. I would also encourage her to eat more during the next few meals and prevent her from giving away her snacks because her insufficient intake might weaken her body. I’d share my concern with Peter and keep an eye on her through the rest of the day and the next to make sure she doesn’t show any symptoms of illness. If she continues to shiver/get worse, I would let base camp know and keep in touch about her ongoing health, in case an evacuation is necessary.

•	Another major concern is Phillip’s aloofness, and Daniel’s subsequent relegation. Phillip’s notion that he is more mature than the other FOPpers and his tendency to ignore them in favor of talking with Peter run counter to FOP’s mission of promoting inclusivity and equality. Phillip’s self-superiority is concerning not only because he is putting down his peers but also because he is undermining the group’s cohesiveness. I would ask Phillip to help me cook dinner as a guise for talking with Phillip privately and bring the issue to his attention. I would constructively remind Phillip that just because everyone else didn’t take a gap year, doesn’t mean they aren’t as mature as him; just as they can learn from him, he can also learn from their different backgrounds and perspectives. I’d remind him that he is here on a group trip meant to orient everyone to their freshman year at Harvard, and since every FOPper will be new to the college experience, he should, in addition to getting to know his leaders, get to know his fellow FOPpers, such as Daniel, better. (I would address the issue of Daniel’s exclusion separately.)

•	Renee’s alienation by Lizzie and Matilda’s conversations is another major concern, as it also undermines FOP’s mission to transcend interpersonal differences of race, gender, religion, political affiliations, socioeconomic backgrounds, etc. It’s great that Lizzie and Matilda are bonding over their similarities, but their talk of their wealthy upbringings is degrading Renee’s FOP experience. During dinner, I would make an effort to get Renee to open up by engaging her in a conversation with the group. After dinner, I would ask Lizzie and Matilda to help me wash the dishes, and use this time to remind them not to get cliquey and that some of their conversation may make others feel excluded. That night, I would separate Lizzie and Matilda into different tents, so that they have an opportunity to get to the know some of the other FOPpers.

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[While I have not had much experience with the outdoors, I am an incredibly active and adventurous person and am looking forward to learning all the skills necessary to become a FOP leader. Growing up in Los Angeles, the only real outdoor experience I have had so far has been participating in FOP. Nevertheless, I enjoy challenging myself and opening myself to new experiences. From camping in the Sahara Desert to trying black pudding(congealed pig’s blood) in Scotland, I am always eager to try and learn something new. Although I am not skilled at backpacking or mountaineering, I am very active and swam competitively for ten years, played water polo for three years, and now, run, just for myself. I am Red Cross Lifeguard and First Aid certified and have taken women’s self-defense courses. I have always been interested in becoming a FOP leader, but was deterred by the fact that I can barely read a compass. As I am very close to several FOP leaders, I have come to realize that this was a silly excuse, as I know that FOP will teach me everything I need to know. I love everything else about FOP: its’ mission, its’ role at Harvard, and its’ community and I am excited to become a part of that community. ]]></Q6.1>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[As someone who loves new experiences, I consider myself a very open and welcoming person. However, even more than new experiences, I love meeting new people. I think that making first-year students feel comfortable is the most important aspect of FOP, and as such, I feel that I am good at getting to know people. In nearly every experience I have had, I have made incredibly close friends with whom I am still in contact today. While a lot of people are surprised that, say, I am still friends with my camp friend from the 8th grade, I know that I work to maintain relationships because I greatly treasure the people I have met.  I particularly valued the sense of community I had within my FOP group, and have worked to maintain those relationships. Although we don’t have group reunions anymore, I do live with one of my fellow FOP-pers and regularly see and rely on my leaders for advice and support. I know that one of my goals as a leader would be to maintain those relationships, and emphasize the fact that the FOP leaders, and team are a great support system. I consider myself a very encouraging and positive person and I think that attitude is especially necessary when leading a group of students so that they feel comfortable and open to new friendships. I think my enthusiastic and supportive attitude will serve me well as a leader and as a resource for new freshmen.  ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[As I explained above, I think my greatest challenge in leading FOP would be my lack of outdoor skills. As such, I believe that being a confident leader, if I am not confident in my basic skills to lead, would be difficult. However, assuming that I do gain confidence in my skills, I think my greatest challenge would be making on-the-spot decisions. I really like having a co-leader because I usually need someone to bounce ideas off of. While I would not say that I am indecisive, and if I do need to make a quick decision, I will, I don’t enjoy making quick decisions because I am always worried that I will be making a mistake. Perhaps it is the perfectionist in me, but I know that it is certainly something I need to work on. I like having time to think and contemplate about my choices, which I know is not necessarily the case in life, or in FOP. I hope that being a FOP leader will allow me to become better at making quick decisions, with prudence. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Returning back to Harvard this semester, I had to make one of the hardest decisions of my life: whether to continue taking Arabic. While this might not seem like a big decision, especially in the grander scale of things, for me, it was incredibly difficult and monumental. I had previously thought that I wanted to obtain a citation in Arabic, and work in the Middle East. Not continuing Arabic meant that I would not be able to obtain a citation, and I would lose two summers and an entire academic year that I had devoted to the language. Even if I took a break for a semester, I would lose much of the progress I had made, spending my summer in Jordan. Even more importantly, not continuing would preclude me from working in the Middle East, a dream of mine. Clearly, not continuing Arabic was not on the “path” and goals I had set for myself. However, continuing would mean that I was devoting myself to something I was not entirely sure I loved. While I did, and still do, love the language, the study of Arabic was incredibly arduous, and I did not feel particularly rewarded. Changing what I want to study, and possibly do in my life, is an incredibly difficult decision. Nevertheless, I went with my gut, which told me that I did not want to work in the Middle East, or devote the majority of my time at Harvard to. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My overall main concern is the comfort level and cohesion of the group. As such, my top three concerns are Lizzy, Philip, and Kelly. Lizzy clearly seems uncomfortable, and perhaps belittled, since she does not have experiences similar to those of the two other female FOPpers. She might be feeling isolated or alienated, and the fact that she talks less frequently indicates a character change. I would try to engage her in conversation that would make her feel comfortable, perhaps about her plans at Harvard or her interests. I would also try to engage the other two girls, Lizzie and Matilda, in similar conversations so that the general subject changes from backgrounds, which might make some students feel uncomfortable, to future plans, something to which they can all connect and relate. Philip seems to be creating somewhat of a rift in the group dynamic. He is both alienating himself from his classmates because he thinks he is too mature, and seems to be annoying Peter, whom Philip thinks is his buddy. While I certainly cannot force Philip to be friends with Daniel, or Peter to be friends with Philip, I think that they all need to treat each other with respect. As such, I would maybe pair Philip and Daniel to do something together, perhaps fill water bottles or clean dishes, to see if a shared experience could help them bond a little.  I don’t think Peter has done anything wrong, as he “listens to all of his stories and occasionally asks questions.” However, I am worried that Peter, as a FOP leader, is not showing leadership and taking the high road. Lastly, I am worried about Kelly, as she seems like she could be feeling uncomfortable, and could possibly have an eating disorder. While obviously I am not a doctor, I would just keep a closer eye on Kelly to make sure that she is getting enough food, especially since we need lots of energy for our climb. As she is quiet, I would also try to engage her in more conversation, or perhaps a trail game like “contact.” Lastly, as Peter announced our ‘competition.’ I would make teams of FOPpers who, it seems, have not interacted with each other a lot yet. I would probably take Renee, Kelly, Matilda, and Philip, and have Peter take Lizzie, Mark, Suzy, and Jack.  I chose Renee, Kelly, Matilda, and Philip because I wanted to keep an eye on Kelly, see if perhaps Renee and Matilda could become friends if Lizzie was not there, and see if Philip would warm to these ‘younger’ students, once he is a team with them and away from Peter. I would advise Peter to keep an eye out for Mark and Suzy, although I am not too worried about ‘hop’ on FOP – and might suggest that he make a casual comment reminding them of the policy, and I would also hope that he try to engage Jack more.  ]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[The first thing someone would probably notice about me upon meeting is my laugh. Not that I have a distinctive laugh or anything of that sort, but it’s easiness and prolific nature is one that can garner quite a bit of attention. Personally, I’d like to think of it as disarming, warm, and welcoming, because I try to be that in almost all circumstances. I think one learns the most about a person when one is willing to poke some fun at his or herself, so I try to be that person willing to take a fall to lighten up the conversation. Not to say I can’t be serious. I can whenever the situation calls for it—the students I tutor would be the first to tell you that! I try to strike a balance of that whenever I am to be the leader or a teacher in some capacity. I also believe that my own personal perspective coming from an area where it is unexpected for a student to apply such an institution as this, let alone attend it, can be a positive addition to a group leading first-years. The leaders of these groups often times serve as the first real connection to the place where the students are expected to study at for the next four years; I think I could help relate to students who came from backgrounds similar to mine and also provide a different kind of insight to those who didn't. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[Personally, I work my best as a leader, tutor, anything of that nature when I feel confident in the material and in the situation I’m placed in. As a leader of a FOP group, you have to maintain your sense of confidence in your skills while also recognizing that there are a plethora of variables that can change up the game plan. Uncertainty in situations tends to make me become a worrywart—not quite the level of an overbearing mother, but still enough for me to have been the so-called “mother” of my hiking group at home. Trying to find balance with this I think may pose as a challenge, but one I would happily undertake. In my tutoring over summer, I most recently worked in a situation that constantly had different game plans, and I had to earn my confidence in what I was doing. My employer knew I had never worked that extensively with a student with autism, but hired me because, as she said, I seemed (from her interview) like someone able to learn and adapt quickly. From that experience, I found that even while entering a situation where ambiguity is constant, I can still manage to find myself and do whatever it is I’m supposed to do with self-assurance and vigor. Gaining confidence in a subject is always a battle hard won with me, but I continually make that battle. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[In the summer before senior year, my parents had given me the option to not go on the family trip to Mammoth Lakes. I took about a week to answer, because I found really sound, good reasons for picking either choice. In my head, I reasoned I could spend more time with my friends, especially as I had a car, and most of them had cars and licenses as well. However, I also thought of how I wanted to spend time with my family and see Mammoth again, which is most definitely one of my favorite places, especially in the summer. To help clear my thoughts, I eventually took a walk with my dog and mentally went over why I would rather do each, and how I would feel if I were not able to do that. I also tried to gauge my “gut-reaction” to either action, since I've found that one should follow their instincts. I wish I had considered how much work it would be trying to navigate the world of living on one’s own for like two and a half weeks (and by work, I generally mean the amount of cleaning I would have to do in regards to the various chores normally divvied up and what it takes to cook for one’s self constantly). However, despite that particular lack of foresight, I remained happy with my decision to stay home. I had summer work; I craved the ability to get away from everyone for a while but still retain the option to hang out with my friends and go on adventures with them (like to the beach!).   ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Although there were other concerns I had while reading the scenario, the three problems I saw that should be addressed immediately involved FOPpers Renee, Mark, and Kelly. With Renee, I saw how she was beginning to feel excluded from the other members of the groups due to their different backgrounds. Personally, this was one of my fears when arriving at school as a first-year, but FOP, for me, ameliorated those fears. If I were a leader of this group, I would like to do the same for the first-years who shared similar concerns, or began to feel out of place due to it. Our experience on FOP, especially interpersonally with the other students, can help shape the perception of Harvard for the students as they get ready for Freshman Week. The duty of these pre-orientation programs is to help the first-years ease into the new culture of being a college student, so an issue of feelings of exclusion should be addressed. In this situation, I would try to strike up a conversation with Renee, relating my own background and learning more about her, hopefully being able to expand this conversation to the others—maybe Kelly and Ryan who are being fairly quiet so as to also try to get them to open up. I know talking about our backgrounds with my FOP leaders and the other FOPpers made me feel more at ease. In regards to Mark taking “carrying a huge amount of weight”, I think that while a subtle issue because he appears to be handling it, it should be noted because he is taking most of the group gear in addition to also helping the others out with their personal gear. Each person should be able to handle their gear, and the group gear should be divided up somewhat equally. While it’s great he’s helping out, it may turn into a health concern. The next day is over some rough terrain and everyone need to be at their top, which may not be the case if someone decides to take on more than he or she can handle when he or she doesn’t have to. In an effort to solve this, I would oversee the division of group gear and make sure that everyone has a fair amount, and I would also help check packs to make sure their packed the most effective way. In regards to Kelly, I would want to watch out for her because of her not eating all of her portion and the shivering. These can be signs of poor health and health should be the main concern. To address this, I would remind the group to always consult the leaders about even the smallest health concern, like blisters. My FOP leaders did this, and I thought it opened the door to being more open. While I normally fear bringing too much attention to myself over inconsequential items, that assurance that no problem is too small or too big is really reassuring. I also would remind the group before the next chow time how important it is to eat and feed your body after how much work it’s done.  ]]></Q7.5>

August 2012: 7-day camping in the Black Rock City Desert, Burningman with 1 other person and coordinating with 3 other camps. Packing, setting up camp, acquainting myself with desert survival tips, glitter. 
January 2012: 15-day Death Valley Field Camp with the EPS department. I went for half of the month-long field camp and was assistant camp cook because the head cook had great skills and hair. Most of the day, I hiked and mapped rocks before I had to get back surgery last January. (all healed!)
June 2013: 14-day trek in Kyrgyzstan with 1 friend, helped arrange logistics and checked routes to particular campsites.

Harvard Undergrad Beekeepers: co-founder an co-prez
Summer 2012: taught science aboard the BioBus, a nonprofit laboratory that travels around the country to bring excitement and hands-on microscopy experience to under-served communities with an inspiring supervisor, a visionary young scientist, who built a mobile classroom inside of a 1974 city bus converted to run on used vegetable oil, learned the value of being a mobile education enterprise, meeting people on their home ground in order to reach them most effectively. 
Summer 2013:  internship educating young Kyrgyz farmers about the craft of beekeeping while trying to incorporate pasture conservation, humbling experience because I was the only American in the organization and was the only beekeeper in the education team, and even I was just a beginner, I learned people like beekeeping facts if presented with tangible skills in the process.  </Q6.2>

		<Q7.2>"Really tall, wily, so if a bear comes around you'll probably be screwed, sneaky creatures like foxes and gnomes are more your bag, you make people feel very comfortable, you have an earnest warmness that makes people feel validated and ready."- a friend firing off some stuff standing by as I stressed about this. 

I would like to think I am humble because I can't answer this question, but the truth is that I am not humble and that my strength in leading a group of first-years would likely be my great desire to impress them and unabashedly try to make them think I was mad cool. I think I would be a great FOP leader because all I would want to do would be to support them in such a way and to the point that they would forever remember their FOP trip. Formation of fond and experience-crystallizing memories, and cute is what we aim for. </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[I am not the most patient person on the inside. Externally, I will appear placid and calm, but that's the first warning sign of an internal cauldron of anxious baboon backsides. I noticed as a writing tutor in high school that I value expedient solutions more than doing justice to the process of arriving at personal solutions. I would sometimes correct the punctuation and syntax in an ESL student's paper instead of step-by-step guiding them to do it themselves. To break this down: I might find it difficult to simply listen to a freshman worry or angst about not being able to make it up the next mountain. I will need to try really hard not to jump into a mode where I prescribe actions (and try to turn everything a party) in order to sidestep talking about feelings of doubt or worry. That will be my greatest challenge, listening non-directively. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>When I left school to take a medical leave of absence after nearly 13 weeks in my first freshman year, the biggest factors I considered were health-related and ultimately, I decided that honoring health and physical limitation. In that case, and in many cases, taking time out is sometimes more important than gunning for the reward of putting one's nose on a particularly gnarly grindstone, because often from the latter situation, one emerges with less ability to stop and smell the flowers. I hurt my back running track and field, then I became a bit of a physical therapy hermit, and withdrew from earnest relationships with peers, worried that my injury was the only thing I could talk about. I was immensely externally buoyant, but the weight of not running and having fairly severe nerve pain colored my experience Harvard a particularly drab shade of ambivalence. I wanted to want to be at this school, so I took a time-out, suddenly and much to the shock of most of my 2014 classmates, but their reaction gave me a flood of appreciation and a pang of regret for not opening up sooner to the empathetic individuals around me. I wouldn't have taken a leave of absence by any other process, but it did make me realize the profound importance of casual check-ins. You're right, the decision doesn't even have to be a monumental one. </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[1.) The caricaturing of the FOPpers is perhaps my number one concern. That their personhood could be reduced in the narration (and it seems between FOPpers as certain folks fall back into roles as side-kicks or puppy dogs) causes me to be worried about the way that a FOP trip could become like a bad episode of Survivor. I like to think we would be dealing everyday with new people and new days. Allowing small personality traits or stories to become the representation of a person's personality for a week-long trek bothers me, so I would seek to make sure that there were multiple nodes for expressing one's "game face." 
2.) The sunset paragraph hints at a difference in energy levels of the two co-leaders. Peter seems like he wants to make everything into a riot/race/game, and I seem much more interested in the social dynamics of small interactions and the pressures of competition outweighing the potential for thoughtful exchange. This would be big concern and would need to be mediated by regular co-sit downs and open checkins. 
3) Of course approaching Kelly seems like a huge crossing of the Rubicon moment. Do you ask her if she needs a little extra support, indicating to her that you notice some sort of warning sign, or do you act in such a way that you believe her to be able to take care of herself. I would be worried about my ability to approach her with the proper tone, but of course I would talk to her and maybe ask about dietary limitations or ways she prefers to eat at home and maybe talk to her about the inputs and outputs of a biological system and how she is in the wilderness and that the shift of output might need a shift of input. I think sometimes a bit of chatting in the abstract leads into a discussion more elegantly of the specific issues that she is facing potentially regarding eating. ]]></Q7.5>

		<Q7.2>I think one of my strengths would be having a clear sense of purpose for why I want to be a FOP leader.  While I was unable to join a FOP trip this past year, I am fortunate enough to have an older brother who is a Sophomore at Harvard.  From day 1, I was able to meet many friends through my brother, and always had the sense of security from knowing that I was with family.  I know that the transition to college is not always so smooth for incoming freshmen, but I think it should be.  It would be really important for me to be able to impact a group of freshmen and make their transition as smooth as mine has been, so I would take every care to build friendships with and support structures for my FOPpers.  
     Also, I think that this past year I gained good experience in managing groups and forming friendships because of my roles as student body president and president of my Christian fellowship.  I learned how to better instruct small groups, both explaining and assigning tasks, and I also gained experience in maintaining a healthy group environment by keeping morale high and trying to avoid the formation of cliques.  Being a camp counselor for a group of six middle schoolers this past year furthered my growth in this area since I had to stay positive with the kids while dealing with some minor conflicts between group members.  Therefore, maintaining a positive attitude is a strength that I think is crucial to any outdoors trip, and I feel confident that I can do so.
</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[One challenge (at least based on what I know now) would be managing the more technical elements involved in backpacking.  I have camped before but never backpacked, and I am lacking in some skills such as building fires and setting up tarps.  However, I relish the opportunity to master these skills so that I can not only lead groups in the wilderness but also improve my own enjoyment of it.

Another potential challenge would be managing any drama that might arise within my FOP group.   While I believe I have a pretty good understanding of how to deal with groups, any form of conflict, even if handled well, can be an unfortunate take-away from an outdoor experience.  My own personal challenge, therefore, would be to try to turn those conflicts into a constructive experience for all parties involved and to foster friendships where they seem impossible.

A final challenge might be the ability to balance my own excitement over the outdoors with my more immediate purpose of impacting freshmen.  No doubt I would like to instill a passion for the outdoors in my FOPpers, but I would hate to place any members of my group in a situation where they feel uncomfortable or unsafe because of a decision that I made out of a spirit of adventure.
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One difficult decision that I have had to make was actually deciding to come to Harvard, and in doing so, live very far away from my younger siblings for most of the year.  Unfortunately, the college decision-making process came during a difficult time for my family, the details of which are really irrelevant.  As a result, I struggled with the fact that I would be leaving my younger brother, a freshman in high school, and my younger sister, a junior, I the middle of a difficult situation.  I am close with them, and I know they are great kids and set in their values, but I couldn’t help but feel that to some extent I was abandoning them. 

For a while, I considered going to a local school that would allow me to both stay close to home and get an education, at least until my sister was out of high school.  Another option was to go to a small Christian school that was only a three hour drive from home, a place where I would have been very comfortable and where I would have had the opportunity to drive home pretty frequently.  It wasn’t until I had discussed the situation with my younger siblings, my mom, and my pastor that I was finally able to come to a decision.  Through these conversations, I realized how many people were really looking after my younger siblings, and how great their friends and support groups were.  I was able to find peace of mind that my siblings would be well cared for, and I realized that the opportunity I had been given to come to school here, step out of my comfort zone, and test my limits was something that could not be passed up.  So far, this decision has been a real blessing.  I know that I could not have come to such a decision without help, and I really believe that I took enough time to appropriately consider my options and make a thoughtful decision.
]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My first concern is that my co-leader Peter, may be a little out of his groove.  Not that getting off trail for a while is really a problem; my greater concern is that he may be getting annoyed with Mark.  To address this, I would have a quick conversation with Peter while the FOPpers are setting up tarps.  I would just go over our route for the next day with him and take the opportunity to talk with him about how we can best bring unity to our group.  This would entail discussing ideas for how to get Phillip to start to look outside himself and start to have positive interactions with the other FOPpers.  This might involve trying to get a game or conversation going over dinner, but either way, I want to make sure that I am on the same page as my co-leader.  I really think that unity among leaders is necessary to produce unity within a group.

My second concern is that Kelly may not be taking the proper actions to stay warm and fueled for the trip.  The last thing I want is for one of my FOPpers to get sick because I have not taken the right precautions to make sure they are properly equipped.  I would probably first try to address this in front of the group as a whole, without singling out Kelly or making her feel uncomfortable.  By talking to the group about the importance of eating well and staying warm during strenuous outdoor activity (in a non-threatening, light-hearted way), I would hope that Kelly would realize that something very simple can make her trip much more enjoyable.  

My final concern is for Renee.  I also come from a small town, and while I have been blessed with many amazing experiences and the chance to do a bit of traveling, I relate to Renee in that I sometimes feel uncomfortable when the conversation shifts to topics that alienate someone because of social class.  I feel that the best way to address this would be to shift the conversation to deeper topics, to give the FOPpers a chance to learn more about each other beyond appearances.  Some of the best times and bonding experiences I have had were at camps, talking having surprisingly personal conversations around a campfire with people I may not even know well.  There is something about such an environment that really allows people to open up and create great memories.  I would try to start such a conversation by asking the FOPpers to give a short autobiography at dinner about who they are and what makes them tick.  If all goes well this could promote unity and maybe even help with some of the other issues we are experiencing.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[As a FOP leader, I believe my strengths would lie in my outgoing personality and enthusiasm for the outdoors! I would love to really get to know the freshman and hear their stories, and I would give them all of the help, advice, attention, and enthusiasm that I could so that they felt as prepared for college as I felt after my trip. I think my love for physical activity and challenges would come across as a great motivation for the freshman to push themselves in a physical sense but also in personal development. I can get lost in conversations for hours with anyone and I try to make the most out of every situation. As a leader, I would be able to relate really strongly to the freshman because I was in their shoes only this past summer. I don’t have all of the answers, but I would always encourage the community aspect and the value of fellowship so that the FOPpers will feel like they have family before they even set foot onto campus. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[As a leader, I think that the greatest challenge for me would be to make sure that everyone was on the right physical level. I personally love physical activity and have played sports all my life. It would be a challenge for me to resist the temptation of not physically pushing myself but also all of the campers too far outside of their comfort zones. I would have to regularly check to make sure that all of the campers were working hard enough but weren’t physically outside of their capabilities. I would have to be very responsive to how each of the campers were physically reacting as well as their mental states and be understanding of that. I feel confident that I would be able to keep the physical exercise at a level that's suited for all people, but I would have to be aware of it. ]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[One of the most challenging decisions I had to make involved someone I loved very dearly. The summer before my junior year, I was casually making plans with one of my friends when I noticed that something was off in her joking manner. She casually mentioned a problem, but when I asked her about it further she told me that she was suicidal. Completely unqualified, I was stunned, scared, stressed, and a lot of other emotions. More than anything though, I felt love for my friend and I wanted nothing more than to make sure that she was safe. As a friend, I wasn’t qualified to be her therapist but I could always offer her someone to talk to and all I could do was tell her how much she is loved and valued. I had to decide what adults to disclose this information to. The hard decision came between respecting her wishes but also making a judgment call on what was best for her safety. I thought about it, prayed about it, and talked to her about what adults we could tell. I felt strongly that her parents should know because it would help settle a lot of brokenness that she was experiencing from not being understood by her parents. I knew that it was a critical decision and I constantly thought about what to do. In the end, we came to an agreement that we would tell her parents and a teacher that she trusted. I am absolutely thrilled to say she is doing better than ever today, and I was so glad that I could help out a friend.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[
Concern 1: The first thing that I would do is make sure that set up for the night was done properly. I think it would be great to get everyone really excited about setting up camp and such, but after a long day I would want to make sure that safety came first. I would first want to make sure that everyone was well rested, that the tarps are secure for the night, and that everyone knew what the dangers were around the campsite. Even though its cliché, the safety first rule would be the first thing that I would ensure to make sure that the rest of the trip was remarkable!

Concern 2: I would turn some attention to Renee and try to get to know her more. From what I can tell, she might be feeling excluded from the group because she doesn’t have the same experiences. I would want to make sure that she didn’t feel inferior but instead embraced the stories that she had to offer and felt comfortable speaking up and being an active part of the group. I would spend time during the hiking talking to her, getting to know her, and doing whatever I could to make her FOP trip the most memorable. Sometimes relationships can get weird without people realizing what is actually happen. I would try to engage more people in group conversations and make the FOP family feel like a welcoming, non-judgmental group for everyone. Whether it’s with Renee and the other girls or it’s between Philip and Peter, I would work on group bonding and openness to make sure that we had a truly loving and genuine support group. 

Concern 3: I wouldn’t assume anything was going on between Mark and Suzy, but as a leader it would be my job to make sure that everyone is happy and healthy. This includes making sure that there is no hop on FOP, but doing so in a way that didn’t make them feel uncomfortable or let them think that I was assuming anything. I would instead just try to make it a comfortable environment for friendships to grow first and foremost.

Fall 2011: FOP 80, participant
Summers 2004-2007: various canoe day trips as a camper at summer camp

In high school I didn’t have any backpacking experience and hadn’t heard of anyone that did. When I announced I had signed up for FOP, my high school friends and I hoped, both jokingly and with secret sincerity, that I would make it to the first day of college in one piece. My wonderful experience with FOP addressed my desire to no longer view backpacking as an inherently dangerous or reckless activity. Since FOP, I’ve tried to hike and backpack whenever possible. I think being outdoors provides uniquely precious opportunities to appreciate nature, and to appreciate the skills and experiences of myself and others. I would be so excited to learn about planning trips.]]></Q6.1>

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[Something I value immensely about FOP is the program’s ability to convince every participant to suspend cynicism and “buy in.” One strength I feel I could bring to FOP is my experience being a participant who did not initially “buy in” to FOP. I was overwhelmed by the cheers in the Yard and hesitant to share feelings during the first group experience-synthesis exercises; I initially concluded that the effusiveness of FOP simply did not fit my personality. Before FOP, I was so incredibly afraid of college that I was incapable of acknowledging my fears. But throughout the trip I slowly began to “buy in” and I returned to campus genuinely excited for college for the first time. Through introspective reflection as well as hindsight analysis with my FOPmates, I have come not only to recognize and understand my fears, but also identify what parts of FOP and what specific actions of my leaders helped me to overcome them. I feel that the ability to empathize with fearful students is integral in leading a trip that is accessible to all participants—not just those who have very positive expectations for college. I think my friendliness, reverence for the outdoors, passionate love for the Harvard community, and admiration for the FOP mentality are strengths. I have spent 2.5 years trying to understand how FOP gave me the tools to love college at a point when I didn’t want them, and I’m finally ready to share my love for FOP with new first-years. ]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[The greatest challenge I would anticipate for leading a FOP trip is presenting the confidence in outdoors skills necessary to both teach participants and to make them feel safe. Though apprehension about my lack of outdoors experience previously kept me from applying to be FOP leader, I now know enough about the FOP community to understand that if I take advantage of all resources during training, there is no reason why I shouldn’t be perfectly confident in my skills by the time that the trip begins. I also think that perfecting the relationship with one’s co-leader is integral to creating a great outdoors trip. It can certainly be difficult to trust another person with your emotions, but I think a great co-leader relationship must balance trusting your co-leader validate your decisions and when they do not, and trusting that they will respect decisions you will not yield on. It involves trusting and validating each other’s vision, hopes, and apprehensions about the trip. I think that creating such a relationship is absolutely challenging. However, I also believe that the FOP community is comprised of some of the most thoughtful, engaged, and perceptive people on Harvard’s campus. This means that as I would be trying to build a meaningful and productive co-leader relationship with a FOP leader I may not know well, I would be sure that the other person would also be working hard to make the relationship, and therefore the trip, a success.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[In the summer between my senior year of high school and my first year of college, just three months after getting my driver’s license, I bumped my car into a bus. I was driving down a suburban road. The road had one lane in each direction and did not have a shoulder. This meant that when my lane of cars encountered a bus waiting at a bus stop, the bus was taking up nearly the entire lane. Worse, the bus stop was just before a bend in the road, meaning it was difficult to gauge whether it was clear to quickly swerve into the lane of oncoming traffic to pass the stopped bus. The two cars in front of me paused briefly but made the risky maneuver. I decided that was unsafe and that I would wait until the bus moved. Eventually, cars piled up behind me. People honked incessantly and yelled at me to move. I felt so much pressure that I made the maneuver, but I swerved so tightly that I hit the bus. It slight: the passengers didn’t feel it, the bus wasn’t damaged. I know I made the wrong choice to give into pressure when driving. I was right to be distrustful of the maneuver—it was reckless. I wish I had considered that my inexperience made me less likely to pull of the maneuver smoothly and more susceptible to peer pressure.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[Since there are no immediately pressing safety concerns, I would first want to spend time talking to Peter about how he is feeling and what he is thinking about what is going on with the trip. He may feel self-conscious about leading the group down the wrong trail. I want to make sure he's doing well and is feeling optimistic, and I want to address any negative feelings he may have. Maybe there is a specific explanation for why he got so lost earlier; maybe there isn't. Maybe there is a specific reason why I didn't notice we were going down the wrong trail that I want to share with him; maybe there isn't anything specific. Either way, there is certainly something that is not jiving between Peter and me, and I should make sure to fix that. Before Peter and I begin talking at length, we would speak briefly about how to carry out the task he promised. I would suggest splitting the FOPpers into groups that would separate Mark from Suzy, and Daniel and Kelly from Philip. I think it is important to follow through on the task Peter promised although I don’t feel that a competition is an activity that I would personally encourage on a FOP trip.  In my brief conversation with Peter I would explain that I did not feel comfortable holding this competition, and ask how he felt about changing it into a non-competitive, quality- and skill-oriented task. Either way, I would encourage us to demonstrate small versions of the task first and then each of us make sure that all FOPpers in our group are engaged in the activity. During this teaching activity I would make sure to mention that ensuring oneself is safe and comfortable is an important outdoors skill; I would explain that shivering is not a good sign and is something that should be addressed. I would be sure to take the group with Kelly. If Kelly did not pick up on the hint, I would be more forward with my safety suggestions. Afterwards, during dinner, I would try especially to engage Kelly, Jack, and Daniel in conversation in dinner. Then we would all participate in the group activity that Peter and I had previously agreed upon, and I would make special note of how each FOPper behaved during the activity. After everyone was settled, I would speak at length with Peter. I would both address the concerns about Peter and explain my primary concerns about the FOPpers (Kelly’s safety, and Kelly, Jack, Suzy, and Daniels’ enjoyment of the trip) to Peter. I would suggest moving FOPpers in the hiking line tomorrow to encourage all members to connect with other FOPpers and stressing safety as a priority.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1>July 2012: FOP 81 - service trip in Vermont with Jackie and Anna as my leaders. I was a groady and eager participant since it was the first time I had any experience in the out doors. 
July 2013: Trek to Antaragange - 2 day night trek to mountains near Bangalore with Bangalore Mountaineering Club. I initiated the registration, formed a group of coworkers to go, bought the food and supplies for the trip, and organized registration for myself and my fellow American intern. 
August 2012: Trek to Kottebetta - 2 day trek to mountains with Shiva temple near Bangalore. I also sought out registration for this trip and bought the needed supplies for it. 

Growing up in China and in the US, I have not had much experience in the outdoors because my family never had the resources or the information about how to start. But after FOP, I have actively tried to be more proactive in staying fit and exploring new fields, even while I was far from home. I have enjoyed all my experiences in the outdoors so far and I look forward to learning more outdoor skills and spending more time in outdoor experiences. My first experience in any kind of outdoor activity was going on FOP 81 my freshman year. Even though the trip was hard, I felt like I really challenged myself both mentally and physically and enjoyed getting to know my classmates. From FOP and my interactions with my fellow FOPpers, I got to know myself better and become comfortable with who I am and how I interact with others. Having realized my role in a small setting before school started was an important factor in shaping how I started my year at Harvard. Further, I felt that the outdoor skills that I learned on FOP could be used in many situations and could be especially useful in an emergency. Since FOP, I have gone on two short backpacking trips, both during my time interning in Bangalore, India this summer. In preparing for the trips and during the trips, I recalled and used a lot of my experiences from FOP. I am so excited to learn more about the outdoors and to go on more trips that would help me hone my skills in the wilderness. </Q6.1>
		<Q6.2>2013-Present - Founder and Chairperson of Women Engineers Code Conference for Harvard Women in CS, Chair of Internal Relations for WICS
2013-Present - Finance Chair, Webmaster and Midfielder for Harvard Club Field Hockey
2013 - Software Development Intern at Jana Care Solutions in Bangalore, India
2013 - Course Assistant for CS50
2013 - Intern for Teach for America in Four Weeks for America at UP Academy  Boston
2012 - Weekly Programming committee member for Harvard Students for Education Reform

High school - weekly volunteer in Recreational Therapy 
High school - weekly forensics teacher to middle school students

I have always been very interested in the science of teaching because I think it is the simplest way for everyone to leave their impact on the world. Being on staff for CS50 this past year definitely made me realize that, especially at 3AM, I loved teaching more than doing my own problem sets. In addition, this past year, serving on the boards of WICS and Club Field Hockey has taught me a lot about how to work effectively in a team while helping everyone balance our busy lives at school. Throughout high school, I held state and community-level leadership positions for a large community service organization called Key Club, during which I learned the importance of working professionally and efficiently. </Q6.2>
		<Q6.3><![CDATA[As a CS50 course assitant, I gained patience and the ability to gauge understanding and invent new methods of explanation. This past year, I have also interned with a TFA corps member and experienced the techniques that resulted in highly effective learning. I have served on board positions of Club Field Hockey and Women in CS, during which I was introduced to a variety of different perspectives from fellow students. Interning in India this past summer helped redefine my career goals and help me come to terms with my family's expectations of me and my expectations of myself. Being inspired while abroad to be more involved in social impact technology has led me to start a team with my fellow intern in India to work on a low-cost, portable Fetal ECG. We just finished our application for the Indo-US Endowment Fund and I feel so happy to have discovered what I am passionate about after keeping an open mind during this past year. Furthermore, after reading Lean In this summer, I was inspired to start the WECode conference and devote myself to a cause that I would have never considered one year earlier. My experiences this past year has taught me to stay open-minded and allow yourself to be inspired. From my first hand experience, I would hope to instill this characteristic in my FOPpers. After being gaining experience abroad and in global service, I have come to realize my values for genuine conversation and my penchant to build meaningful and profound relationships. I found this to be key to my personal developement this past year. 
In terms of more outdoor experiences, I strived to go on treks and went on two while I was abroad in India this entire summer. As a board member of Club Field Hockey, I have attended all games and practices and helped organize events with the captains. I am an active runner and participated in my first race (Brian Honan 5K) this fall. ]]></Q6.3>

		<Q7.2>Living and climbing in close proximity to a few individuals could lead to tense situations that escalate quickly so I hope to remain calm and guide everyone through thinking through the situation. My greatest strength is my ability to stay clear-minded and retain foresight. In situations of emergency or conflict, as a leader, I would be able to assess the situation with an open mind and work efficiently to come up with a plan. I also hope to engage in conversations with FOPpers in a meaningful way by asking them about their family, passions, and inspirations. I hope to get know them as unique individuals and help them discover their uniqueness before starting school.</Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>My greatest challenge would be staying patient during the entire trip. They will be learning a lot of new things about living in the outdoors and I hope I will be patient enough to explain, repeat, and clarify. I have learnt a lot of patience in my teaching experiences but there is always more room for improvement. In addition, I want to keep an open mind about the different backgrounds they come from and I hope they will become open minded as well. I may not have met individuals with the backgrounds they come from and may find it difficult to engage with them initially but I hope to get to know them and learn from them as well.</Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>For most of my life and probably since birth, I have been pre-med. Growing up in China, it only seemed natural that I would follow in my dad's footsteps, become a doctor, and lead my family forward. In my freshman year, I started to have second thoughts. I was doing clinical research with an orthopedic surgeon at Beth Israel and I became disillusioned with the lifestyle while shadowing him around the hospital. I struggled with the decision to, instead, study computer science and leave the field I had grown up in. I was afraid that I was not as prepared or as smart as other students and I feared that I would not be able to keep up. I still have those fears, but after interning for a startup this summer in India, I realized that my love for the subject and my drive to create social impact technology was far more important. So, last month, I declared Computer Science as my major and Global Health and Health Policy as my secondary. During the decision, I prioritized a lot of factors like my future, family, and prospective lifestyle but I wish I had been more aware of the importance of the community of each field. As a serial psetter now, I am glad to have found a community who can support me through tough weeks and help me find a balance in my time here.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[I would first discuss with Peter to set the logistics for tonight and tomorrow's trips. I would discuss with him the challenges of the five mile hike tomorrow as well as the possibility of FOPpers being extra tired tomorrow morning because of the long day today. I would also make sure we are on the same page with the routes tomorrow so as to avoid the problem of the wrong route again. With his input, we would decide together whether to change any plans or pace. Next, I would speak with him about how he has been gauging the different situations that has arisen among the FOPpers. I would note the possible problem points arising in the relationships between FOPpers, as noted above, to verify that he has been seeing the same trend and that I had not missed anything else. From there, I would discuss with him how to handle each situation. First I would discuss with Peter how to redirect the way he has been interacting with Phillip and Daniel to focus more attention on the inter-FOPper conversation rather than interaction with Peter. One way we could do this is to have Peter connect the conversation with Phillip to Daniel and prompt Phillip's interest in Daniel by helping them find something they are both passionate about and, in turn, make it less of a give-and-take relationship. As a next task, I would converse with Peter to figure out how to get Renee reinvigorated in the conversation or perhaps with other members of the group. Renee seems to be representating an important fear among freshman of not fitting in with people from other backgrounds and we could definitely use this opportunity to help Renee and everyone realize those fear. Next, I would discuss with Peter how to engage Kelly and Jack more, perhaps having more in-depth conversations with us first and transitioning them to other FOPpers. We could also do some sort of game (maybe anonymous) of noting to the fact that Kelly has been very self sacrificing for the group. Further, I would discuss with Peter whether and how to approach Suzy and Mark about interacting with the rest of the group more. ]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[July 2007: Ten-day mountaineering trip in the Italian Alps (right on the Swiss-Italian border) with my dad, and led by a guide. I love every second of it; I learned about glacier formations, the meteorology of the area, and I used Crampons for the first time ☺. 

July 2008: Twelve-day mountaineering trip through the Swiss Alps with my dad, and the same guide. This time, we had the chance to summit several 4000-meter peaks, and do some rock climbing. I had a great time participating! 

June – July 2009: 7-week bicycle ride across America with six friends from school. We started in Seattle, Washington, and ended in Portland, Maine. I helped to plan our route (we didn’t want to be on any highways). For the majority of the trip, we camped along our route. 

March 2011: Two-day hiking expedition in Panama and Costa Rican cloud-forest. I learned a ton about the animals and environment of the region I was in. 

July 2013: Six-day hiking trip through Yosemite National Park with four friends. We had a great time, learning about the Park’s unique botany and wildlife from a Park Ranger who led our group trip. 

January 2014: I’m going to take the WFR program at Harvard!

		<Q6.2><![CDATA[Summer 2007- Summer camp counselor to four and five-year olds for two weeks. This experience taught me to be as helpful as possible to someone if they ask for it. A lot of my campers needed couldn’t tying their shoes, putt on their swimsuits, and cleaning themselves up after ice cream spilled all over their shirt without assistance. I learned to help them out when they needed it, and do it with a smiling face. 

Fall 2010- High school cross-country captain. I think that this really contributed to my growth as a person because I learned how to make tough decisions in a leadership position. When my teammates stole athletic jerseys from rival schools, I had to tell them that it was not okay, and to return the clothes. 

Years of 2010 and 2011: Junior-Senior Friends mentor at high school. Mentored a twelve-year-old boy who had escaped from Baghdad with his family when the US invaded. Probably one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve ever had; through being his “big brother”, I learned that if you make an active effort towards someone, you can completely change their perspective on life. 

Spring 2012: Served as Special Projects Manager for the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum. I was tasked to lead a committee that would revamp our performance dress code policy. In this capacity, I learned how to listen to people, especially when they held strong views on a certain issue, and respond to them considerately and meaningfully. 

2012-2013 School Year: Member of the Harvard Krokodiloes (Harvard a cappella group). Although I did not have any leadership or teaching experience as a member of this group, I would say that I definitely learned how to be very diplomatic. It can be hard when you are working super intensely with the same eleven other guys twelve to fifteen hours a week. Sometimes tensions run high. From this experience, I think I learned how to keep calm when faced with tough social situations, and also present my own ideas in a kind, constructive manner.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[The greatest strengths that I could provide in leading a group of first-year students would be my abilities to be communicative, patient, and organized. 
I have always prized my ability to communicate with people. I think that it is essential to understand what other people are feeling in a given situation, and respond in a way that is accommodating as possible. When I biked across the U.S., choosing our rest stops each day would sometimes be quite a debate between my friends. Everyone’s conflicting views could be tough to handle, but I think that my ability to talk through the situation—and respect other people’s perspectives—made this planning process possible. 
I am also quite a patient individual. I have no problem being the guy at the end of a group of hikers, making sure that the slower members of the group are coming down the mountain fine. I think his patience helps me be a facilitating teacher. It can be hard to learn a new skill, but being creating an environment where people can feel comfortable making mistakes, they feel uninhibited to try their best. 
Finally, I love to plan. I am the type of guy who writes highly detailed paper outlines, and schedules every day as best as he possibly can. I think that this ability for organization has made me a really disciplined individual, intent on working through problems and meeting goals that I set. 
For these reasons, I think that I could be a strong leader. 

]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[The two greatest challenges that I would have in leading a group of first- year students would be my perfectionism, and my propensity for excessive, self-criticism.
	Because I am so intent on “hyperplanning” whatever I do, I sometimes discover that it is difficult for me to adapt when plans go awry. Although I am slowly learning to “roll with the punches”, I think that not meeting goals that I set for myself is difficult. When situations do not go the way I want them (like ensuring that my group hikes halfway up a mountain by a certain time of day), I usually need to take a few breaths and realize that it is not a massive dilemma. 
	Often though, when I feel that I have not met my own standards, I can be really hard on myself. For example, I could easily see myself being upset if I did not feel that my attempts to make my first-year students bond were successful, or if I did not feel that my students liked me. In this capacity, I would have to make sure to not get too bummed out. 
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>As it is for everyone, choosing my blocking group freshman year was tough. I was caught between choosing one of two groups:  one made up of a bunch of friends from the freshman rowing team, or the blocking group that my freshman roommate--my best friend-- wanted to be in. Although I was good friends with my buds on the crew team, I knew that I had made a friend for life in my current roommate. But, to complicate matters, I felt more of a collective connection to my group of rower friends than the rest of the blocking group that my roommate hoped to join. Ultimately though, I decided to join the blocking group with my freshman roommate. I have always believed that it is better to have one great friend than many good friends. And I still hold by that. Two years later, my roommate and I are still as tight as ever.  Essentially, I think it is about the strength of the relationships that you have, not the number.</Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[While there are various concerns I have about the social dynamics that I observe within this scene, the three concerns that I have identified are most important to me because I believe that they could jeopardize the physical well being of members on the trip. They are the following: 

1.	Mark’s choice to carry a large amount of weight
2.	Kelly’s behavior
3.	Peter’s leadership of the group

Mark
	Although Mark may seem physically capable of carrying a large amount of extra weight, I worry about him hurting himself in the process. He could be placing more stress on his body than he is aware, and, if he is doing it daily, he could overstrain himself to the point of serious injury. In response to this problem, I would try to have a one-on-one conversation with Mark, telling him that I really liked his enthusiasm for helping out, but was worried about how much gear he was carrying. I would ask him if he felt that it would be okay if he could give some of the equipment to other people to carry for the next few days.

Kelly 
	Kelly might be my most pressing concern on the FOP trip. Her actions suggest that she might be really sick. The fact that she is shivering tells me that her core body temperature is much lower than it should be, especially given the fact that she should be giving off excess heat from having hiked all day. She might have a fever. The fact that she is getting “full quickly” when eating also is unsettling, because you expend a lot of energy when hiking, and would probably want excess calories to compensate. I would sit down privately with Kelly, and tell her that I was really concerned that she was getting sick. I would ask her how she feels. If she felt badly, I would try to get her to wear more layers. If she felt fine, then I would let her know that she could always talk to me if she felt herself feeling worse. 

Peter
	Some of Peter’s actions seem like they could jeopardize the welfare of the group. I am concerned that he took the group down the wrong trail for half a mile. Parts of that trail might have been dangerous to walk though; if the group had also been on it during the thunderstorm, and there was no tree cover, it could have been problematic. Also Peter’s announcement that there would be a competition to see who could put up the tarps first seems troubling because I would think that you would want to make sure that you set up your campsite carefully. It might rain in the middle of the night, and if your tarps are hastily erected, they might blow over. I would talk to Peter individually about my concerns. I would also talk to him about the other problems I had seen with the other FOPpers, and ask him if he had any solutions to my concerns.

		<Q6.3><![CDATA[This past year, I have had challenging experiences that have offered me new perspectives on my experience in college and deep insights into my own character. I have not had any institutional teaching or leadership experiences since my last application, however, I feel that I have grown in a way that will augment the capacities I already have. For example, I already knew last year that I would be a passionate leader. With that I am sure that my excitement for the trip, for Harvard, and of course for getting to know my FOPpers, would offer energy to the group. After a year of challenges coming from situations with my family, my living arrangements, and my own health, I have come to fully realize that the passion I could bring to the trip comes from a highly emotionally reactive part of my character. I have since learned that although this trait can bring excitement and joy, it can also bring anxiety and sadness. Having a greater awareness of this tendency within myself has given a stronger ability to predict how I will react to certain situations. This power has allowed me to become a better planner because having a better idea of how I will react allows me to be more prepared to handle the problem. I have had other similar experiences that have offered me insights into my character in a way that I think will be valuable to my ability to be a leader. 	
	I also have had some more experience outdoors, particularly in New England. In the spring of last year, I participated in the freshman seminar in the Harvard Forest, which gave me more experience with the different landscapes of New England’s forests. I also spent some time in August hiking in Northern New Hampshire, which also has further acclimated me to the type of terrain we would encounter on a FOP Trip.

		<Q7.1>1</Q7.1>
		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I have both strong traits and skills that I believe would make me a very capable FOP leader. One trait, I touched on above, is passion. Once I am feeling connected to something, I invest a lot of energy into it. As a leader, I would surely share all my excitement about the college, getting to know each of the FOPpers, and sharing my ideas and interests while learning from them. I also feel that compassion will be useful. I would hope to make the trip feel as safe and rewarding as possible, which would definitely involve handling the feelings and concerns of my FOPpers. I feel that with regard to group morale and individual FOPpers, I would be prepared to try to understand how they are feeling, to listen, and to offer advice. This especially will come in handy because I surely can identify with many of the worries about the transition to college that my FOP trip helped me with, so I am sure I will be able to empathize. 
In addition to these traits, I feel that I have a set of skills that will prepare me to be a FOP leader. I feel that I have strong communication skills, including both teaching and having serious individual conversations. I also have a background conducive to outdoor preparedness: I love to cook, I have had some medical training as a Certified Nurse’s Aide, and I have experience working outdoors through my jobs both in Carpentry and Maple Syruping. 
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[One major challenge I would be faced with is feeling anxious. It could take the form of whether everyone on the trip is enjoying themselves or whether the trip will go according to plan. It is the reverse side of being highly reactive. I don’t think these are unreasonable concerns I only hope that they do not get in the way of me being the excited, passionate FOP leader I can be. I certainly think I have a set of skills to appropriately deal with that anxiety, but I will have to be aware of it and plan ahead for it. 
Another area about which I am concerned is mediating potential tense relationships between FOPpers. I feel that my communication skills and compassion will prepare me well to handle one on one situations or group moral but I feel less experienced in easing tense relationships in a leadership role. I imagine that my other skills can be built upon to handle this situation, and I am ready to learn.
I also am a little apprehensive about making decisions with my co-leader. I feel that because I am reactive, and I would have strong opinions in that situation I would need to get to know and to plan ahead with my co-leader how we are going to make decisions. 
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>Although it is a little ironic, I would like to expand upon my decision to not complete my FOP leader training this past year because I think it can show my passion for the program and provides context for the growth I have experienced over the past year. Circumstances academically and at home made it best for me to follow through with my plan to study abroad in South Africa, but it would only allow me a short break. I, however, was so excited about FOP still because it was such a formative part of my first year at Harvard and I really wanted to be able to give back to the Harvard community in that way. I also knew it would be such a huge opportunity for personal growth as a leader, about which I felt very excited. The difficultly of the upcoming summer with FOP as a part of it and my excitement to hold to my commitment existed in tension for a while as I collected more information. I discovered I could re-apply even if I withdrew from the program. I also realized as I became more worn out that I really did need the break, and that my health in the present needed attention. I then decided to officially withdraw from the program. I wish that I had reflected earlier in the process that I needed the time to rest and that I had overcommitted, even though it was tough to quit. </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[ I am most concerned about Renee, the relationship between Daniel and Phillip, and Kelly. I am very concerned about Renee because it seems that she was very excited about coming to college at the beginning of the trip, but now, after speaking with Lizzie and Matilda, she has become more quite. I suspect she feels either very intimidated by Lizzie and Matilda or perhaps she feels alienated because she had a presumably very different upbringing from them. I really want Renee to get the most out of this trip and to hear out what concerns she may be having about coming to college. I would spend perhaps some individual time speaking with her or perhaps I would use a processing activity that could allow her concerns to be voiced and recognized. I don’t want her to feel more nervous about starting school. 
	I am also concerned by the relationship between Daniel and Phillip. Daniel seems to really be reaching out to Phillip to make a “cool” friend. Based on his comment about getting “trashed”, perhaps he is concerned about how he is going to get involved in the social scene. Phillip, on the other hand may be trying to connect with Peter because he in fact is also nervous about the social scene, because he is worried about adjusting into the freshman class having taken a gap year. If the relationship between them doesn’t become more tense, I don’t think it would be necessary to mediate between them, but I think it again would be important to design a processing activity where the FOPpers have an opportunity to express their concerns and worries about college. 
Lastly, but probably most importantly, I am concerned about Kelly. She is giving away some of her food, she has been shivering, and she seems excited to keep hiking. I get the impression that she is physically not well and perhaps has not been eating enough. I don’t know if that is because she does not like the food or it is something else. Regardless it is worth a direct conversation because proper nutrition is definitely a high priority for safety given the rigor of the FOP trip. I would not necessarily push her beyond comfort, but if she is not eating, I would enquire why so that I could held prepare her for a safe rest of the trip and for the coming school year.

		<Q7.2>I'm friendly and I get along with most people. I'm an avid traveler and I love new experiences. I feel comfortable outdoors, and I think that I could make the students I would be leading feel the same way. I work well under pressure, and have experience handling difficult situations in new settings.  </Q7.2>
		<Q7.3>- I haven't done much camping in the US. While the basics are similar wherever you go, I don't have any experience with the local terrain. 
- I'm older than most students which is both a blessing and a curse. I've traveled quite a bit, backpacked for months at a time etc. But I'm worried if a. students will relate to someone who is more than 8 years their senior. and b. that I might not have the patience I would have had a few years ago to deal with silly behavior. I don't think would necessarily be an issue, but it's something I'm certainly thinking about. </Q7.3>
		<Q7.4>I found the decision to come to the US for school very difficult. It meant leaving my family and friends who are very important to me, traveling to a foreign country, not really knowing anyone going in, starting from scratch and making a life for myself, the huge financial expense etc. 
What ended up motivating my decision to come to the US despite these concerns was a combination of feeling that Israel was a little too small for my liking, an interest in living abroad, the fact that Harvard is the only American school anyone in Israel has heard about. I was particularly excited about the notion of a liberal arts degree rather than a specialized track, which I would have followed had I stayed in Israel. </Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[My most pressing concern in this case would be to set up camp before it gets dark. It's unclear from the text whether or not this has already happened. Dinner is cooking--does this mean the tarps are already up? In any event, ensuring the group's overall physical well-being would be my first concern.  

Second, Kelly's shivering strikes me as something out of the ordinary that might require immediate attention. The fact that she gives away her cookies/dessert treats and tries to smooth over the shivering might suggest that she is suffering from some sort of eating disorder. While there could be me many other plausible explanations, this possibility is certainly worth considering. Either way, she shouldn't be shivering. For starters, I'd keep an eye on her during dinner. Make sure she's eating. Ask her how she's doing. Check to see if the shivering continues. I would likely consult with Peter the other FOP leader, ask what he thinks and that he also remains alert to any other troubling signs. Being alert and aware while showing genuine interest and concern strikes me as the ideal immediate plan of action. If I sense there might be a real problem, I fear I might have to confront her and send her home. This is not a decision I would make lightly but a student's safety really does come first. 

Lastly, some of the group dynamic issues might require attention. There are always people who feel left out, there usually is a Phillip or two in every group, and it isn't uncommon for 18 year old guys to talk about "getting trashed." That being said, there is still value in shaking things up and trying to facilitate new dynamics. For starters, once dinner is ready and the camp is set up, I would make sure we hold some kind of group activity. Ask people how they're doing, share experiences from the day, and play some icebreakers. I might also divide them into pairs and ask them to rotate every hour during the hike tomorrow so they have the chance to interact with new people. It's only the third/fourth day of hiking and the FOPers probably still don't know each other very well.

		<Q6.1>- August 2013: FOP trip. This was my first overnight backpacking experience. I learned a significant amount about extended hiking trips, and about several skills necessary for FOP, including cooking, setting up camp, sumping, safety, and wilderness etiquette.
- Summers 2010-2013: Sailing instructor. I am knowledgable about knots. I also am very comfortable spending nights outdoors due to overnight sailing races. I also had to become CPR qualified for this position.
- I have participated in single day hiking trips since I was very young. I am comfortable hiking on mountains, and I am comfortable with planning and provisioning for single day trips.</Q6.1>
		<Q6.2>2010-2012 - Saxophone teacher. 
2010-present - Sailing instructor. I spend every summer teaching a sailing class to middle-schoolers and young high-schoolers. I have received my level 1, 2, and 3 sailing instructor certifications, each of which required classes on effective teaching. I have had to create lesson plans, lead discussions, design and conduct land and water drills, and coach sailors at regattas. I have also been responsible for their safety while on the water. 
2012-2013 - Crew team captain. As team captain, one of the roles I found to be most significant was motivating my team members and ensuring that they bonded well.
September 2013-present - Dorm intramural captain. It is my responsibility to keep people motivated and excited about intramural sports.
September 2013-present - NROTC. One of the primary goals of the Boston Consortium's NROTC program is to train midshipmen to be leaders. After a single semester in this program, I've already learned a lot about what it takes to lead and assume responsibility for a group.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[FOP had a tremendous impact on my first semester here at Harvard. Until FOP, I had never spent so much time isolated from the outside world; I had never spent so much time hiking through what I considered the wilderness. I was very caught up in how much “fun” I was having. Towards the end of the trip, though, I realized how much more it had meant to me. I realized that the novelty and fun of hiking was not the most significant reason that I had enjoyed every moment so much. Before FOP, I had never gotten to know a group of people so well so quickly. I would soon embark on an entirely new part of my life, and I already had a group of people who I knew would support me no matter what.
For me, the bonds I formed and the smooth transition into college made FOP so significant. I have extensive experience teaching people new skills through my summer teaching job, and I am experienced with leading and motivating groups through crew captainship, intramural captainship, and NROTC. I feel that the most significant contribution I can make, however, is creating the comfortable environment, sense of security, smooth transition, and bonding experience that my FOP leaders taught me through example. I would come to FOP with the intention of using everything I’ve learned about leadership through the program and throughout my life to provide incoming freshman with as powerful an experience as I had.]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[There are several challenges I will face as a FOP leader. Although I am certified in CPR and First Aid, I am not qualified to handle a true medical emergency. I would also have to work on becoming lifeguard certified if I became a Switch Canoe leader. Besides the certifications, however, there are a few more personal challenges that I would have to face. However, I see the FOP training process and FOP itself as an incredible opportunity for personal growth.
While I have some experience as a leader, I continue to face the challenge of learning to better understand the people I lead. Every group has a different dynamic and faces different challenges. I strive to better understand empathy, and I believe that fully developing leadership skills takes more than a lifetime.
In addition to improving as a leader, I would also like to improve as a follower. I recognize that all of the experienced FOP leaders have a lot to teach me about hiking and about leading. I am looking forward to having the chance to follow them so that I can better learn the skills that they’ve worked hard to master, and better learn how to learn.
]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[This year, at one of NROTC’s leadership labs, the marine option midshipmen led an event called combat tactical decision games. The purpose of this activity was to train midshipmen to make difficult decisions under high pressure. Between each scenario and during each briefing we also had to participate in rigorous physical training (pt) so that we would be physically exhausted. During each scenario we tried to make tactical decisions while a marine shouted at us and verbally led us through a situation.
	I was designated squad leader for one of the “missions.” I had to separate myself from the group so that a marine could brief me. I then reported it to the rest of the squad. I glossed over some of the brief’s details so that they would better understand the general purpose of the mission. I failed to consider how important small details could be in a complicated situation.
	According the the scenario, several protesting civilians had smelled chemical weapons and blamed the Americans. I had forgotten that we had a translator as a resource, who could have diffused that situation quickly. I thought first of my squad’s safety. When the situation escalated, I chose to bring my squad behind cover, forgetting the possibility of a second attack. I also chose not to bring in air support, which would have indiscriminately killed hundreds of civilians. I stand by both those decisions, although I wish I had given more thought to the resources at my disposal. ]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[In this scenario, I worry a lot about situations in which foppers don’t feel comfortable. The issue involving Phillip, Daniel and Peter strikes me as important, because feelings of superiority can ruin a group dynamic extremely quickly. My goal as a leader is to ensure that everybody begins college feeling like they have a support network, and that they are not alone. I would begin my attempt at solving this issue by actively engaging Daniel in conversation. I would do what I could to make Daniel feel like his experiences and contributions had value. I would not ignore Phillip, but I would attempt to steer conversation away from Daniel’s adventures so that each fopper feels equally respected. Peter’s reaction to Daniel presents another aspect to this problem. As a leader, Peter should show respect for each person he leads. Not only could eye rolling cause Phillip to feel hurt, but other foppers could emulate the leader’s behavior, and in turn lose some respect for Phillip and be more inclined to disregard their other peers. I would privately suggest that Peter not react in such a way in front of the group. It also seems possible that Daniel wants to “get trashed” in order to somehow impress Phillip. Putting them on equal ground in the context of the trip may quell such behavior.
	I see the issue with Lizzie, Matilda, and Renee as equally dangerous toward the group dynamic. While FOP should help to forge the type of strong friendships that Lizzie and Matilda seem to be developing, it should do so entirely inclusively. I would respond to this situation in a similar way to how I would respond to Phillip and Daniel. First I would ensure that Renee feels included by engaging her in conversation. I would then attempt to talk with the three girls together, trying to steer conversation more toward what brought them together in the first place, and away from the topics that seemed to be dividing them. Renee may feel excluded and self conscious because she has had a very different life experience than the other girls. I would lead by example to try to encourage openness and communication on hikes and during group activities, so that each fopper could begin to feel more comfortable with his or herself and with each other. This would also help Kelly and Jack. It takes a longer amount of time for some people to open up than others, and this solution would help facilitate it.
	While the foppers’ personal experiences are extremely important, trip logistics can still present significant problems, and a successful trip relies on everybody playing a part. The day described had been stressful for the leaders, and it would be important to ensure that the rest of the trip go well. I may plan to leave earlier the next morning. I would also be sure to manage each foppers’ expectations, letting them know exactly how difficulty the hike would be. It would be discouraging and therefore slow if we led the foppers to believe the day’s hike would be easy, and equally discouraging if they believe it will be extremely difficult. Spacing out breaks, offering encouragement, and keeping a team motivated are essential decisions required of any leader, and I would treat these responsibilities seriously when planning logistics.]]></Q7.5>

		<Q6.1><![CDATA[Summers 2005-2010—I was a camper and then a counselor at an overnight camp for boys on a small lake in New Hampshire.  We often went on outcamping trips, some of the memorable ones included a hike up Mt. Washington and a week-long canoeing/hiking trip around Lake Flagstaff and the Bigelow Preserve in Maine.  (I helped plan the route and campsites for the latter.)

Fall 2011—I worked on several WWOOFing farms in New Zealand.  The work was general agricultural labor—digging ditches, planting seeds, feeding chickens, you name it.  The workers often lived in tents and cooked on camp stoves.

Summer 2012—I volunteered on the Appalachian Trail Crew near Mt. Bigelow, ME, for three weeks.  We lived on the trail five days of the week, building rock bars, stone staircases, and clearing brush.

August 2012—My dad and I went on a weekend hike up to Mt. Lafayette.  I did all the trip planning for that one.

October 2013—The HOC leader training trip went up to the AT around Crawford Notch.  I was a participant but in this case that included leading for a portion of the trip.]]></Q6.1>
		<Q6.2><![CDATA[2009-2011—I was the president of the Model UN team and an editor of the school newspaper (pretty standard for a Harvard student, I know).  These were the first real “leadership” positions I have held, so I learned a good deal of basic lessons from these experiences.

2009-2010—I was a counselor at a summer camp.  I taught campers tennis and lacrosse, and supervised the high ropes course.  More importantly, I lived in a cabin with eight campers ages 11-13 (thankfully I also had a co-counselor in the cabin).  Learning to manage the social dynamics of campers was truly invaluable.

2013—I taught a short seminar on behavioral economics to a group of Chinese high school students at HSYLC in Beijing.  (HSYLC is Harvard Summit for Young Leaders in China.)]]></Q6.2>
		<Q6.3><![CDATA[Teaching a seminar at HSYLC this past summer allowed me to see classroom learning from the other side.   I remember two particular issues that I grappled with while teaching.  First, I taught students who learned at wildly different speeds.  If I moved too slowly, some of the best students in the class would lose interest and clearly stop paying attention, but it was hard for me to risk leaving behind slower students who hadn’t fully grasped a piece of the material.  Second, I had a couple of students who were particularly eager to talk to me after class and were seemed to want to connect with me more than their peers.  I definitely did not want to give preferential treatment to any individuals and end up with teacher’s pets.  But, I did want to encourage students to show a real interest in my seminar, and have a friendly relationship as well.  Practicing strategies to balance these competing concerns made HSYLC a very worthwhile experience.

I also joined HOC as a new leader this year.  I have not actually led any trips yet, but as of last week I am officially allowed to!  The fall training included WFA certification, a trip, and some skill sessions.  Ben Raderstorf led the training trip that I was on in October; I am sure he will talk more about that in his letter.

		<Q7.2><![CDATA[I think that my greatest strength is in fostering a positive social dynamic.  The best part of my FOP experience was the friendship and camaraderie among the FOPpers and leaders.  The connections we made on FOP were completely natural, but the context in which they were made was, in a sense, artificial.  FOPpers enter into a completely new social realm, and naturally it is the leaders who set the tone for interactions in this new social space.  I am constantly attuned to the tone of a group and feel that I can make it a positive one.

One of the most important traits in a leader is confidence, and I definitely have confidence in myself and in being in the outdoors, and project that to those around me.  (Hopefully not too much though.)  Being confident does not just mean feeling great about oneself, but feeling comfortable about oneself.  If a leader projects this message it is certainly contagious within a small group, and tends to set a very good tone.
]]></Q7.2>
		<Q7.3><![CDATA[In leadership positions the greatest challenge for me is probably to give autonomy to people that I am leading.  I tend to have a very detailed vision of how things will play out and I need to remind myself that even if I have a good way of doing something there are plenty of other ways to do it which are at least as good as mine.  It can be frustrating for me to watch someone really struggle with a simple task—tying a knot, for instance.  It is always very tempting for me to just do it for them—I could certainly do it faster—rather than being patient enough to let them master the skill on their own.  The skill-learning element was not too important for me on FOP because I had hiked in the past, but I do think it is an important part of the experience for many FOPpers, particularly those who have never been backpacking.  The greatest challenge is, of course, the unknown—the weakness that I do not yet know I have, the challenge that I have never before faced.  To the extent that there is any way to prepare for unknowable circumstances, I think it is not to micromanage, but to be flexible and let people do things their own way.]]></Q7.3>
		<Q7.4><![CDATA[Earlier this year my phone, which I’d had for several years, finally bit the dust and just stopped working.  It was a pretty dinky piece of technology, right out of 2007, with no snapchat, no email, not even an internet browser.  I thought about replacing it with an iPhone; I dreamed of getting emails in a timely manner, posting mobile uploads to my facebook, or at least properly receiving messages with emojis.  My friends wanted me to get in on group iMessages, and I knew that tinder was just what I needed to be a superstar in the college social scene.  But, I asked myself, do I really want to document every mundane daily event with a vine and share it with my thousand closest online friends?  Can’t I survive a few minutes of boredom on the subway without browsing my facebook newsfeed?  Smartphones provide obvious benefits, but I think that spending more time using the internet and being tuned in to social networks actually makes me less connected to other people.  So, I picked another dumbphone, and now if I want to contact a friend, I use my phone to do the only thing it can do—make a call.]]></Q7.4>
		<Q7.5><![CDATA[It is certainly hard to narrow this situation down to only three issues.  On a broad level, it seems that some dynamics are developing which prevent all the members of the group from interacting on a level social playing field.  Early on, this can easily be fixed, but if it is allowed to fester, the gap between different members in the group will only grow larger and become harder to close.

One thing that really jumps out at me as a potential growing problem is Daniel’s mention of “getting trashed” back at school.  (Aside from being totally unwholesome and probably illegal,) discussion of drinking is often socially isolating and can create a rift within a group.  A small sub-group of people will have drinking experiences to talk about, many will have none at all, and some will feel the need to exaggerate their experiences to be in part of the group that can talk about drinking (or smoking, or really any kind of illicit behavior).  The air of mystery and the intentionally vague euphemisms that kids use to talk about drinking adds to this separation.  I definitely would not actually come right out and tell anyone not to talk about drinking (I would only try to directly forbid a discussion topic in super extreme cases), but would carefully guide conversation away from the subject.  Often kids want to talk about drinking to impress peers that they think are cool, and it seems clear that Daniel is trying to impress Phillip in this case.  Fortunately, leaders are usually perceived as “cool” by default, so if my co-leader and I simply displayed a total lack of interest in the topic, that might be enough to make it go away.

The withdrawn attitude of Kelly, Jack, and Renee are problematic as well, but potentially easier to deal with.  I would try to get them involved in some fun trail games, which would hopefully lead to them bonding more with the group.  There is nothing necessarily bad about being a quiet FOPper and I think the worst thing to do in this kind of situation is to really put the person on the spot by trying to aggressively involve them in conversation, but I would try to make sure that they felt comfortable contributing more to the group if they wanted.

Lastly, I would to carefully consider how to interact with Phillip, who might be at risk of alienating himself from his peers by trying to associate more with the leaders than with the other FOPpers.  I can relate to Phillip’s position, because I took a gap year myself and felt slightly out of place when I returned to the student world.  Gap year kids can be wildly excited to share their stories, and others are often keen to listen, but I would make sure not to be much more intrigued by Phillip’s stories than anyone else’s (at the same time, I certainly wouldn’t roll my eyes).

Before taking action to address any of these issues, I would definitely check in with my co-leader Peter.  Maintaining a strong unified front is critical to good leadership, and Peter has done a few things already today which I would have at least wanted to talk over before doing, so my first step would be to communicate and talk things over with him.
